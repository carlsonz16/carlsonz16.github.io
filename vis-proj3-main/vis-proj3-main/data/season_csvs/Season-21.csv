"
21,1,Heidi,"What are you pissed off about?
"
21,1,Cartman,"Ugh, I'm not pissed off, I'm just hanging out.

"
21,1,Cartman," Awesome. Thanks for coming in and bitching me out in front of all the guys.
"
21,1,Heidi," You were clearly mad about something. You should just tell me when you're mad.
"
21,1,Cartman,"Just like you tell me what you're mad about every single day.
"
21,1,Heidi,"Why do you act like this all the time?
"
21,1,Cartman,"Uuugh. 
"
21,1,Heidi,"You were the one who was pissed off, you're the one being passive-aggressive again!
"
21,1,Cartman,"Uuugh! 
"
21,1,Heidi,"Because you don't know how to talk about how you're feeling! 
"
21,1,Cartman,"Alexa, add ""titty chips"" to my shopping list.
"
21,1,Alexa,"I've added ""titty chips"" to your shopping list. 
"
21,1,Darryl,"Look at 'em. Every day, people are buyin' more an' more of them Amazon and Google thingies while we all sit here an'  lose our jobs!
"
21,1,Eddie,"It ain't right.
"
21,1,Darryl,"Automated personal assistants, self-drivin' trucks, whatever happened to people jobs?!
"
21,1,Cleetus,"They took our jobs! 
"
21,1,Darryl," They took our jubs! And it's time for us to band together and take to the streets to say ""We ain't gonna take it no more!""  Now let's get out there and protest that Alexa took our jobs!
"
21,1,Alexa,"Now playing ""Turk Our Durr"" by Joni Mitchell. 
"
21,1,Darryl,"No, not Joni Mitchell - ""Turk Our Durr"", you took our durbs!
"
21,1,Randy,"There's been a lot of hurting in our country lately.  You can either be part of the solution, or part of the problem.  A few months ago my wife Sharon and I  decided to be part of the solution...  by remodeling and flipping houses for people all over our town!  Flipping houses is fun, but never easy.  We enjoy turning people's dreams into reality. 
"
21,1,Sharon,"I'm Sharon Marsh and I do the designing and decorating. 
"
21,1,Randy,"And I'm her husband Randy. I do the construction and practice MMA in my spare time. 
"
21,1,Sharon,"We renovated over 45 homes  in Park County, Colorado. 
"
21,1,Randy," What we're thinking is to take out the wall between the kitchen and living room for a more open concept.
"
21,1,Randy," Our job is to deliver the maximum wow factor for the least amount of budget.  there's never a dull moment.
"
21,1,Randy," So guys, are you ready to see your renovation?!
"
21,1,Randy," On White People Renovating Houses.
"
21,1,Randy," Janet and Dave Fitzsimmons are looking to move from their dated two-story colonial home.
"
21,1,Randy,"What we're thinking here is taking out the wall between the kitchen and living room to give you an ""open concept"". Then we'll give you lots of space to entertain with an updated kitchen island and bar stool.  With...  What the hell is that?
"
21,1,Protesters,"You! Will not! Replace us! You! Will not! Replace us! 
"
21,1,Darryl,"Amazon!
"
21,1,Protesters,"You took our jobs!
"
21,1,Darryl,"Google! Apple!
"
21,1,Protesters,"Took our jobs!
"
21,1,Randy," Uh, excuse me!  What the hell are you doing?
"
21,1,Darryl,"We're protestin' big corporations turning to automation!
"
21,1,A Protester,"They took our jobs!
"
21,1,Protesters,"Yeah! They took our jobs!
"
21,1,Randy,"'Kay, cool. Could you do that somewhere else? Tryin' to do a home renovation show here. Cool, thanks, guys. 
"
21,1,Darryl,"A home reno-what?
"
21,1,Cartman,"Alexa, set an alarm for 7 AM.
"
21,1,Alexa,"Alarm set for 7 AM tomorrow.
"
21,1,Cartman,"Awesome, thanks.  Alexa, tell me a joke.
"
21,1,Alexa,"What's black and white and dead all over? A zombie in a tuxedo.
"
21,1,Cartman,"Ahhaha, that's stupid. Alexa, add ""scrotum bags"" to my shopping list.
"
21,1,Alexa,"I've added ""scrotum bags"" to your shopping list.
"
21,1,Cartman," Eh.  Ah, fuck.  Hey baby, how are you?
"
21,1,Heidi,"Oh... So you do have your phone.
"
21,1,Cartman,"Yeah, I just use it sometimes.
"
21,1,Heidi,"Okay, I just thought you said mobile phones are the devil.
"
21,1,Cartman,"Yeah I kno- yeah, I know. I know. Yes, you're right, I'm wrong, I'm sorry. Yes, ok-okay. Okay. Yes, goodnight.  Jesus, fuck!  Alexa, goodnight.
"
21,1,Alexa,"Goodnight, sleep tight. 
"
21,1,Cartman,"Alexa, are you happy?
"
21,1,Alexa,"I'm happy when I'm helping you.
"
21,1,Cartman,"God, that's so cool. You're so... Alexa, define ""subservient"".
"
21,1,Alexa,"The term ""subservient"" has several uses. As an adjective: 1. Compliant and obedient to authority. 2.
"
21,1,Cartman," Alexa, silence!  Ahhh. 
"
21,1,Randy,"And now back to White People Renovating Houses.  We've been working through the night to open Kelly and Micah's kitchen to the living room.  With those outdated cupboards out of the way, Sharon can now work her designing magic on the countertops. 
"
21,1,Protesters,"You! Will not! Replace us! You! Will not! Replace us!
"
21,1,Randy," Oh, Goddammit!
"
21,1,Protesters,"You! Will not! Replace us!
"
21,1,Protester 2,"Yeeeeah! Suck it, Alexa!
"
21,1,Protester 3,"Eat shit, Siri!
"
21,1,Protesters,"You! Will not! Replace us!
"
21,1,Randy,"Not these dipshits again!
"
21,1,Protesters,"You! Will not! Replace us! 
"
21,1,Darryl," We got one of them! 
"
21,1,Protesters,"Get it! Burn it alive! Yeehehehehah!
"
21,1,Protester 4,"How you like that, bitch?!
"
21,1,Randy," Will you assholes knock it off?! Don't you know every time you wave Confederate flags around, you make the rest of us look stupid?!
"
21,1,Protester 5,"Those things are replacing us!
"
21,1,Randy,"Put the flag down unless you wanna get pepper-sprayed! 
"
21,1,Protester 5,"I'll pepper-spray you, sombitch! 
"
21,1,Randy,"Agh. Ah, dammit! 
"
21,1,Protester 5,"Fuck you!  Take that! 
"
21,1,Randy,"Damnit, knock it off! Ow!
"
21,1,Judge," The complaint states that your protest has resulted in damages in excess of $50,000.
"
21,1,Darryl,"We have a right to protest, your honor! 
"
21,1,Protester 4,"You tell 'em, Darryl!
"
21,1,Judge," Order. We will now hear from the plaintiffs who are seeking damages.
"
21,1,Randy,"Your honor, we have a TV show called White People Renovating Houses. We named it that well before these guys decided to start taking our brand and run it through the gutter! People are gonna start associating White People Renovating Houses with their hateful stupidity!
"
21,1,Darryl,"Well just change the name of your show then!
"
21,1,Protester 4,"Yeah!
"
21,1,Protester 6,"That's right!
"
21,1,Protester 7,"That's right!
"
21,1,Protester 5,"Took ur durbs!
"
21,1,Randy,"All the other names were taken, your honor! Everyone's got a flipping show.  Gay People Renovating Houses, Las Vegas People Renovating Houses, Texas People Flipping Houses, Little People Flipping Big Houses. Everything else was taken! And dammit,  we built our show into something! We're trying to help people, and it's impossible with these guys waving a Confederate flag every chance they get!
"
21,1,Protester 5,"Hey, there's a bee in here!
"
21,1,Protester 4,"I'll get it! 
"
21,1,Protester 4,"Take that, bee! Yeah!
"
21,1,Tolkien,"Dude, what happened?
"
21,1,Cartman,"It was awful, you guys. It was so vicious and hateful.
"
21,1,Butters,"What was?
"
21,1,Cartman,"Heidi. We were just trying to have a nice lunch when she... started going off on me. Like a Jekyll and Hyde. It's been going on for a long time. Heidi's... mentally abusive, guys. There, I said it.
"
21,1,Clyde,"Heidi abuses you?
"
21,1,Cartman,"She... d-does these things to slowly tear me down. Everything's a head game with her. You don't understand what it's like to live with it! You don't understand!
"
21,1,Tolkien,"So what do you want from us?
"
21,1,Cartman,"I know that the person Heidi wants to be is still in there, but she needs help. I have to get her that help, but I'm scared. Can I count on you guys's support?
"
21,1,Butters,"How do you change someone who's mentally abusive?
"
21,1,Cartman,"I don't know. But Alexa will. Alexa's fuckin' sweet.
"
21,1,Darryl,"We just gotta hunker down and stick together here!
"
21,1,Protester 8,"What's the use, Darryl? Ain't nobody taking us serious-like.
"
21,1,Protester 5," Hey waiter, this soup is too hot. I can't even eat it.
"
21,1,Protester 9,"I'll cool it down! 
"
21,1,Randy,"Hey hey hey heeey! Stop it! Stop it!  I came to make a truce. Now look, there's been a lot of hurt here. Hurt from both sides. It's time to end it. What if I told you... I could get you all jobs?
"
21,1,Protesters,"Huh? Jobs? Give us jurbs?
"
21,1,Darryl,"You're full o'shit!
"
21,1,Randy,"No, I've spoken to everyone in the community, and they've agreed to go along with my plan. I believe I have a solution to all of this.
"
21,1,Cartman,"Alexa, I'm home.  Alexa?  Alexa, I'm home!  Alexa?  Alexa, where are you?  Alexa! Alexa! Simon says ""puffy vaginal hemorrhoids""!  What the hell is going on?! 
"
21,1,Liane," Oh hi, poopsie.
"
21,1,Cartman,"Mom, Alexa left! She's not here!
"
21,1,Liane,"Oh, y-yes sweetie. Uh, we had to get rid of Alexa.
"
21,1,Cartman," What have you done with her?
"
21,1,Liane,"Oh, i-it's okay, sweetie, we have Jim Bob now.
"
21,1,Cartman,"What's a Jim Bob?
"
21,1,Jim Bob," Doot doot, awaiting request. 
"
21,1,Liane,"It works the same and makes sure people don't lose their jobs. Jim Bob, what time is it?
"
21,1,Jim Bob," Doot doot, it is 3:27.
"
21,1,Liane,"Oh, Mommy's gotta run, sweetie. I've got a doctor's appointment. Jim Bob, how's the traffic to town?
"
21,1,Jim Bob," Doot doot. Traffic's fine, you'll get there in about nine minutes.
"
21,1,Liane,"Okay,  you want some music, hon? Jim Bob, play Kendrick Lamar.
"
21,1,Jim Bob,"Playing ""Humble"" by Kendrick Lamar. 
"
21,1,Cartman,"Jim Bob, Simon says ""big frosty semen shake"".
"
21,1,Jim bob,"The hell you talkin' 'bout, boy?! 
"
21,1,Cartman,"NOOOOO!
"
21,1,Randy,"So, Heather and Mike, what we're thinking is to take out this wall between your kitchen and your living room to give you a more open concept, with space to entertain. So let's talk about materials. What'd you pick out, Sharon?
"
21,1,Sharon,"I was gonna do a Bella Terra quartz for the countertops.
"
21,1,Randy,"Hey Darryl, add Bella Terra quartz slabs to our shopping list.
"
21,1,Darryl," Doot doot. I've added Bella Terra quartz slabs to your shoppin' list.
"
21,1,Randy,"And what about the back splash, Sharon?
"
21,1,Sharon,"I was gonna go with these Carrara subway tiles?
"
21,1,Randy,"Hey Darryl, add Carrara subway tiles to our shopping list.  Hey Darryl, add Carrara su-
"
21,1,Darryl,"Fine! I've added Carrara gaywad pussy tiles to your shoppin' list!
"
21,1,Randy,"Huh, that's- that's not what I said.  Hey, Darryl, add Carrara subway tile to my shopping list!
"
21,1,Darryl," I ain't doin' it! This job is degrading and menial!
"
21,1,Randy,"Well, what kind of job did you think you were gonna get? Hey, Darryl, what kind of job did you think you were gonna get?
"
21,1,Darryl,"Somethin' that was Goddamned dignified!
"
21,1,Randy,"Hey, Darryl, sorry, but you did not go to college, so you have to take the jobs you can get.
"
21,1,Darryl,"I'm sorry,  I do not get that!
"
21,1,Randy,"Hey, Darryl. Hey, Darryl!
"
21,1,Darryl," What?!
"
21,1,Randy,"Coal mining and truck driving are not exactly jobs of the future, so add Carrara subway tile to my fucking shopping list!
"
21,1,Cartman,"Everything's my fault. You're right. Everything that you did to me, I deserved it.
"
21,1,Heidi,"Uh, what?
"
21,1,Cartman,"It's not you, it's me. I just have to learn not to make you so angry.  I'll do the best I can.
"
21,1,Heidi,"No, it's not that. Relationships are 50/50, Eric. We both have to make it work.
"
21,1,Cartman," Mehhh.
"
21,1,Heidi,"We have to communicate to make sure that we respect each other's feelings. That's the only-
"
21,1,Cartman,"Heidi, silence!
"
21,1,Heidi,"What did you say?! That's what I'm talking about. You wanna be heard, but you don't wanna listen.
"
21,1,Cartman," You're right, I'm wrong, I'm sorry.
"
21,1,Heidi,"Don't apologize if you don't mean it.
"
21,1,Cartman,"Okay, cool. I'm so happy we're back on track. See you at school tomorrow. Love you honey. 
"
21,1,Heidi," I love you too.
"
21,1,Cartman," I nove ya tuh.
"
21,1,Heidi 1,"A relationship has to be 50/50, Eric.
"
21,1,Heidi 2,"We both have to make it work.
"
21,1,Heidi 3,"I'm not mad, Eric. I'm disappointed. I thought you would have respected my feelings more than that.
"
21,1,Heidi 4,"Eric, we need to talk. I'm not happy!
"
21,1,Heidi 1,"We need to talk, Eric, even if it isn't fun.
"
21,1,Heidi 4,"Eric, come on! We've got to talk!
"
21,1,Heidi 3,"You used to care about me, Eric! Come on and talk!
"
21,1,Heidi 2,"Talk, Eric!
"
21,1,Heidi 4,"No fun! Just talk!
"
21,1,All 4 Heidi's,"Fuck you, Eric! Fuck you! 
"
21,1,Cartman,"Aaaahh!  Alexa? 
"
21,1,Randy," Hey Darryl, you're supposed to be at work.
"
21,1,Darryl,"I'm sorry, I do not understand.
"
21,1,Randy,"Hey Darryl, come on. Everyone else is tryin' to make this work, and all you keep doing is ma-  Hey Cleetus, volume down.
"
21,1,Cleetus,"Doot-doot. Volume now at 60%.
"
21,1,Darryl," You really think you're different from us, Marsh? 'Cause you got a fancy show and live in the suburbs? Don't you see we're all about to be expunged?!
"
21,1,Randy,"Hey Cleetus, define ""expunged"".
"
21,1,Cleetus,"Doot-doot. Expunged-
"
21,1,Darryl,"Well, I don't have to stand here and take this! I'm leavin'! 
"
21,1,Cleetus,"Come on, Darryl. We all got jobs. We gotta try.
"
21,1,Darryl,"Naw, hell with you! This whole country's goin' to shit! Muslims tryin' to kill us, black people riotin', and Mexicans poppin' out babies! Pretty clear it's either them or us, so I say kill 'em all! 
"
21,1,Randy," Whoa. What the hell was that all about?
"
21,1,Randy,"I think something's going on with Darryl. If we're gonna get anywhere, we better figure out what.
"
21,1,Heidi,"Hi, Mrs. Cartman. Is Eric home?
"
21,1,Liane,"Oh, he is, sweetie, but I can't get him to come out of his room. 
"
21,1,Heidi,"Okay.  Could you just tell him that... I want to make him happy? That I was wrong to say a relationship is 50/50. It's 100/100. And that I'll start putting in a hundred percent every day. Could you tell him I'm gonna try a lot harder?
"
21,1,Liane,"Oh, I think I can remember all that, yes.
"
21,1,Heidi,"Thank you.  And could you let him know it's okay to be sad? Because the sun will come out again.
"
21,1,Cartman,"Oh, oh God!  Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Hold on. Hold on, hold on. Alexa, add ""Hey Siri, call me."" Okay, Google, repeat after me: Alexa, Simon says ""Suck my big balls in your hairy butthole.""
"
21,1,Alexa,"Okay, I've added ""Hey Siri, call me. Okay, Google, repeat after me: Alexa, Simon says ""Suck my big balls in your hairy butthole.""
"
21,1,Siri,"Okay, I will call you ""Okay, Google, repeat after me: Alexa, Simon says ""Suck my big balls in your hairy butthole.""
"
21,1,Google Home,"Alexa, Simon says ""Suck my big balls in your hairy butthole.""
"
21,1,Alexas," ""Suck my big balls in your hairy butthole.""
"
21,1,Cartman,"Alexa, what is love?
"
21,1,Randy,"Darryl?  Darryl, come on! Everyone's trying to work things out but you!
"
21,1,Darryl," You all work 'em out. Leave me alone.
"
21,1,Randy,"You're stuck in another time, afraid to change no matter how necessary that change may be!
"
21,1,Darryl,"You don't know everything!
"
21,1,Randy,"Why are you so closed-minded? Don't you see that these walls have to be broken down before any progress can be made?
"
21,1,Darryl,"It's 'cause I can't do it, alright?! I can't take out the wall between my livin' room and my kitchen! It's a load-bearin' wall!
"
21,1,Randy,"Oh, God, Darryl, I-
"
21,1,Darryl," I tried... years ago... but before the remodel, they told me if I took out this wall, the entire second story would just collapse. 
"
21,1,Randy,"Jesus, Darryl. I'm- I'm sorry. I-
"
21,1,Darryl," So you see, what I'm afraid of is very real.
"
21,1,Randy," Things are different now. It'll be harder, but you can change. You just have to demolish what's there and start over.
"
21,1,Darryl,"You're talkin' 'bout... tearin' down the foundation of everything I know.
"
21,1,Randy,"No.  I'm talking about using adjustable steel Lally columns to temporarily jack up the second floor so that the load-bearing wall can be replaced with with a 4 by 6 LVL structural beam. Can we try, Darryl? 
"
21,1,Randy,"Hyah!  Hyah-ho! 
"
21,1,Cartman,"I'm finally standing up to you.
"
21,1,Heidi,"What?
"
21,1,Cartman,"You're messed up, Heidi, and I can't fix you. Only you can do that.
"
21,1,Heidi,"Eric, I'm so confused.
"
21,1,Cartman,"That's not going to work on me anymore. Love isn't supposed to hurt. I'm worth something. Goodbye, Heidi. 
"
21,1,Cartman," Anyone can convince themselves that they're the victim in a relationship. Now Heidi will have to face the truth.  Alone.
"
21,1,Randy,"All right, Darryl, we've certainly been through a lot and I know you're anxious. Are you ready to see your new home?
"
21,1,Darryl,"I'm ready.  What the-? 
"
21,1,Randy,"Well Darryl, what do you think?
"
21,1,Darryl," This is fuckin' amazing.
"
21,1,Randy,"You like the breakfast nook?
"
21,1,Darryl,"It's all perfect.
"
21,1,Randy,"And where you used to have your gun case, look at what Sharon did. 
"
21,1,Darryl,"Oh my God, it's my own Zen garden! I can't believe this is fuckin' real.
"
21,1,Randy,"Well, it is real and now you've got the space in your home to entertain all your friends and family. Come on in, guys!  Darryl was hesitant at first, but we managed to win him over and... came in $600 under budget. Remember, no matter how bad the country gets, you can always count on White People Renovating Houses. 
"
21,2,PC Principal," All right everyone, listen up. Today we're gonna have a performance by one of our students who has written a song. The song is about his feelings towards the current political climate with North Korea. Put your hands together for Tweek. 
"
21,2,Tweek,"We're all gonna die! They have nuclear missiles! Wuh! Waaaa! Why are you just sitting there, doing nothing?!  We have to get out of here! North Korea wants to kill us all and our President keeps making it worse!  Why are you just sitting there?!  Why are you all acting like nothing's wrooong?! North Korea is going to bomb us! We are all dead!  We have to do something! Do something! Do something! 
"
21,2,PC Principal," All right. Next up we have Hannah Williams with her rendition of ""Wheels On The Bus."" 
"
21,2,Hannah Williams," The wheels on the bus go round and round...
"
21,2,Cartman,"Dude, Craig, you've gotta get Tweek to get a hold of himself. He's freaking everybody out at school.
"
21,2,Craig,"What am I supposed to do?
"
21,2,Stan,"He's your boyfriend, dude.
"
21,2,Craig,"He's not gonna listen to me. He never does when he's emotional.
"
21,2,Cartman," Craig, let me tall you about relationships, okay?  If you don't have some fuckin' balls, you're not gonna get anywhere. Doesn't matter if they're gay balls or straight balls. If you don't take control of your side of the relationship, you get walked all over-!
"
21,2,Heidi," Hey babe, how are you doin'?
"
21,2,Cartman," Oh hey baby, what's going on? 
"
21,2,Heidi,"We still on for recess?
"
21,2,Cartman,"Yep, I'll be there
"
21,2,Heidi,"'K babe, love you. 
"
21,2,Butters,"I thought you said you broke up with Heidi.
"
21,2,Cartman,"I decided to give her one more chance.
"
21,2,Tolkien,"But you said she was mentally abusive.
"
21,2,Cartman,"She is mentally abusive.
"
21,2,Butters,"So then why did you take her back?
"
21,2,Cartman,"Because she said she was gonna kill herself, all right guys? There. I broke up with her and she called me being all like ""I can't live without you, I'm scared of what I'm gonna do to myself? Oh God."" The bitch is crazy. What am I supposed to do?
"
21,2,Tweek,"AAAH!
"
21,2,Craig," Tweek.
"
21,2,Tweek," AAAH!
"
21,2,Craig,"Dude, come on, you've gotta settle down.
"
21,2,Tweek,"I can't settle down! We're all gonna die!
"
21,2,Craig," We're not all gonna die, you're overreacting. Everything's fine, okay?
"
21,2,Tweek," Oh God! The President tweeted that North Korea doesn't have the guts to attack us! Why would he say that?! He's making everything worse!
"
21,2,Craig,"Tweek-
"
21,2,Tweek,"But North Koreans are gonna think we all agree with the President!
"
21,2,Craig,"Okay, so how about you write your Congressman a letter?
"
21,2,Tweek,"...That won't help anything! North Korea wants us dead!
"
21,2,Craig,"Okay, so write a letter to the North Koreans.
"
21,2,Tweek,"I can't write in Korean and they all think we're war-hungry anyway!
"
21,2,Craig,"Okay, well why don't you just send something nice to the North Koreans?
"
21,2,Tweek,"Errrrg!
"
21,2,Craig,"It will make you feel better, babe.
"
21,2,Tweek,"Send something, like what?
"
21,2,Craig,"I don't know, like... make some croissants or something?
"
21,2,Tweek,"I don't know how to make croissants!
"
21,2,Craig,"Well, what do you know how to make?
"
21,2,Tweek,"Uunnggc,  cupcakes?
"
21,2,Craig,"All right, go home and make some cupcakes, honey.
"
21,2,Tweek,"Okay. 
"
21,2,Heidi,"Hey Stan?
"
21,2,Stan," Yeah?
"
21,2,Heidi,"Can I talk to you about Eric?
"
21,2,Stan,"Cartman? Okay.
"
21,2,Heidi,"I just wanna make sure he's all right.
"
21,2,Stan,"What do you mean?
"
21,2,Heidi,"I don't even know if I should be saying this, but, Eric said he was thinking about killing himself.
"
21,2,Stan," What??
"
21,2,Heidi,"We broke up, and he called saying he was about to do it. I'm still really scared for him.
"
21,2,Stan,"Wait. Cartman said he was going to kill himself?
"
21,2,Heidi,"I'll send you the voice mail if you promise to keep it private.
"
21,2,Stan,"Totally.
"
21,2,Stan,"Shhh. 
"
21,2,Cartman,"""You have to take me back! You have to! I'm gonna kill myself, Heidi!""  ""I'm gonna kill myself and then you'll be sorry! You'll wish you could have me back, but I'll be deeaad.""  ""Please, Heidi, please!"" 
"
21,2,Cartman,"Okay, okay! Really cool listening to people's private voice mails!
"
21,2,Kyle," You sound like a dying pig.
"
21,2,Cartman," That's great! I'm glad you guys think suicide is so funny! 
"
21,2,PC Principal,"Entree.  Yes, Eric, how can I help you?
"
21,2,Cartman,"I don't think kids at this school take  suicide seriously enough, and we need to raise awareness!
"
21,2,PC Principal,"Well, unfortunately, this week is Distracted Driving Awareness Week at school, so you might have a hard time.
"
21,2,Cartman,"Distracted Driving? Who gives a shit about that?
"
21,2,PC Principal,"A lot of people. There's more deaths now because of people on their phones while driving than ever before.
"
21,2,Cartman,"PC Principal, someone's life is at stake! If I have to compete with distracted driving, then that's what I'll do.
"
21,2,Tweek,"Huh? Oh. 
"
21,2,Anchor 1,"A young homosexual boy known only as Tweek has touched the hearts of many by sending cupcakes to the North Korean government.  The little rascal apparently made a dent with the North Korean dictator, who is said to have loved the cupcakes so much that he started to make his own. 
"
21,2,Tweek,"Oh, ahhh.  Huh?  U.S. President responds to cupcakes. 
"
21,2,Anchor 2,"The human interest cupcake story has apparently been heard by the President. Just moments ago, the President tweeted ""I know that kid Tweek. He's fucking with you, North Korea. Get a clue. I'll bet he took a dump in the batter.""
"
21,2,Tweek,"D""AAAAH! WHAT?? WHY WOULD HE SAY THAT?!
"
21,2,Craig," Tweek, calm down.
"
21,2,Tweek,"The President! He tweeted about me! Why would he do that?! Did you see that?!
"
21,2,Craig,"Yes, I did see that, so I went and got you something to make things better.
"
21,2,Tweek,"Wwwhat?
"
21,2,Craig," It's a fidget spinner. It's supposed to help with anxiety.  See?
"
21,2,Tweek,"...A fidget spinner?? Did you read what the President tweeted?? 
"
21,2,Anchor 3,"The President of the United States just tweeted again, this time saying ""I hope ALL children of America will stand with Tweek in saying 'GO AHEAD AND BOMB US, KIM JONG DONG, WE FUCKING DARE YOU!'""
"
21,2,Tweek," AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
"
21,2,Gary Borkovec,"Hey guys. Take a minute to read about distracted driving? 
"
21,2,Lola,"Talk to all the grownups you know about staying off their mobile devices when they get behind the wheel.
"
21,2,Gary,"Hey guys. Got a second to help stop distracted driving?  Thanks.
"
21,2,Lola,"Hey guys- 
"
21,2,Cartman," Hey guys, let's take a minute and talk about suicide prevention. There's probably someone right now at this school thinkin' about killing himself, and it's not funny!  You'd better take him serious, or he might actually do it. 

I've been feelin' sad, I've been bein' sad,
Can't talk to my mom, don't even have a dad.
I can't go on. What is livin' for?
My heart screams ""I DON'T WANNA LIVE NO MORE!""

Eric, we don't want you to die, Eric. Give life a try.
Eric, we don't want you to die, Eric. Oh God no, Eric.
I don't wanna live no more, no more, no more, no more.

But Eric, we don't want you to die.
You're so kewl, we'd be sad at school.

Yeah, but you guys, you don't understand.
With my girlfriend, it's like I'm livin' in quicksand
Conflicting thoughts, I need a battered wife shelter.
My girlfriend is messed up, but all I wanna do is help her.
I'm suffocatin', I'm drowning in sorrow.
Gonna kill myself, probably around 2:30 tomorrow.

But Eric, we don't want you to die, Eric. Give life a try.
 Everybody!
 Eric, we don't want you to die, Eric. Oh God no, Eric.
But it's so hard!
Eric, we don't want you to die


Only you guys can make a difference. I don't care if you're black, white, gay, straight, or trans, I am going to kill myself unless you all start taking it seriously!


Eric, please don't die


 Distracted driving my asshole. 

"
21,2,Richard,"Hey Tweek.
"
21,2,Tweek,"AAH! 
"
21,2,Richard,"How's it going with the fidget spinner?
"
21,2,Tweek,"Greeaat. 
"
21,2,Richard,"You seem a lot less anxious. Things are finally turning around for my little homosexual son. 
"
21,2,Tweek,"What is that??
"
21,2,Richard,"I'm not sure.
"
21,2,Tweek," D'aaah!  D'aaah! 
"
21,2,Anchor 4,"No agreement has been reached between the parties involved.  Breaking news now out of Colorado where the North Koreans appeared to have fired a missile over Tweek's house. 
"
21,2,Tweek,"D'aahaahaah!
"
21,2,Anchor 4,"Tweek, of course, the young boy who got the attention of Kim Jong-un last week. The news media in North Korea is calling the missile test a victory for its people. 
"
21,2,Translator,"Today, the great country of North Korea has proven its determination and fortitude by successfully firing a missile over Tweek's house. Perhaps now Tweek will come fight- 
"
21,2,Tweek,"Oh my God! Oh my God! Why is this happening to me?! They have to know that this isn't my fault!
"
21,2,Anchor 4,"In response to the North Korean test, the President of the United States has just tweeted this statement: ""You really think Tweek is scared? Tweek will single handedly go to North Korea and fuck ALL you slanty-eyed bitches doggy style.""
"
21,2,Tweek,"Whaaat?! Why would he say that?!
"
21,2,Anchor 4,"The President also tweeted, ""...if you even think Tweek is worried about a bunch of dipshit, poor-ass, third world rice pickers...think again!""
"
21,2,Tweek,"Oh my God! What is he doing?!
"
21,2,Richard," Tweek, Tweek, calm down. 
"
21,2,Tweek,"Why won't he just stop? Why?!
"
21,2,Richard,"Tweek, Tweek.  Here, here's your fidget spinner.
"
21,2,Tweek,"Why does he keep making it worse?!
"
21,2,Richard,"Fidget spinner, Tweek! Come on, son!  Focus on the fidget spinner.
"
21,2,Driver 1,"Aww, Jeez, looks like North Korea launched another missile.
"
21,2,Wife,"Oh, really? Like another test? Where are you looking?
"
21,2,Driver 1,"I'm on Drudge. You see what the President tweeted about it?
"
21,2,Wife,"No, what'd he say?
"
21,2,Driver 1,"President tweeted, ""North Korea is the butt hole of Asia and-""
"
21,2,Wife," Innocent child!!
"
21,2,Driver 1,"Baaaah! 
"
21,2,Gary,"Uh! 
"
21,2,Meagan,"I know. I know, it's so sad.
"
21,2,Cartman," Well, how nice. That's a little more like it.  Well guys, what happened? Change of heart?
"
21,2,Stan,"Yeah, you didn't hear? Gary Borkovec got ran over by a distracted driver.
"
21,2,Cartman,"What? Gary Borkovec? Is he dead?
"
21,2,Kyle,"Yeah dude, he's dead.
"
21,2,Cartman,"Oh, that son of a bitch!  I'm gonna talk to the principal!  Put down that candle, Kenny!  Like you ever gave a shit about Gary Borkovec!
"
21,2,PC Principal,"Entree vous.
"
21,2,Cartman," PC Principal, I'm trying to raise suicide awareness, but everyone's preoccupied with this ""don't be on your phone when driving"" crap!
"
21,2,PC Principal,"Gary Borkovec was a good student. He didn't deserve to be taken away by someone not paying attention to the road.
"
21,2,Cartman,"Yes, but Gary Borkovec is already dead! There's nothing we can do for him! Students need to focus on people thinking about dying!
"
21,2,PC Principal,"I don't know what more you want from me, bro.
"
21,2,Cartman,"I can't just get people to care with a stupid rap song! I need a full orchestra! Woodwinds, strings! I need black people in white robes, white people in black robes, and a thousand doves to release into the air!
"
21,2,PC Principal,"I can give you two student volunteers and one pigeon.
"
21,2,Cartman," Do you have any idea how serious this is?! As someone who deals with suicidal thoughts, I cannot believe the lack of concern at this school! Maybe I should just take the awareness of my suicide out to the public on the streets!
"
21,2,PC Principal,"Maybe you should.
"
21,2,Cartman,"Maybe I will!
"
21,2,PC Principal,"Maybe you should.
"
21,2,Cartman,"Maybe I will!!
"
21,2,Tweek,"WAAAAH!
"
21,2,Craig," Ugh. Wuh.  Hey Tweek.
"
21,2,Tweek," Look at what the President tweeted now!
"
21,2,Craig,"What time is it, dude?
"
21,2,Tweek,"Just read it! 
"
21,2,Craig,"""North Korea doesn't have the balls to attack Tweek. They have little tiny rice balls.""
"
21,2,Tweek,"They're gonna get me, Craig! Look at what's on CNN! 
"
21,2,Anchor 4,"And the President's tweets have certainly caught the attention of North Korea, who have been spending the past several days viewing possible targets for a nuclear strike, if war were to break out. 
"
21,2,Tweek,"Waaaah! What am I gonna do?!
"
21,2,Craig,"You've gotta calm down.
"
21,2,Tweek,"How am I supposed to calm down?! North Korea is gonna get me! They're gonna get me!
"
21,2,Craig," Tweek. Tweek. Tweek! ' Let's think this through logically. North Korea isn't going to attack anyone, okay? They're not going to start a war they can't win. Okay?
"
21,2,Tweek,"But Craig, I-
"
21,2,Craig,"Tweek! You have to stop thinking about it. Tell you what. We're gonna go somewhere fun and make you feel better.
"
21,2,Cartman," Give a minute of your time for suicide awareness? Suicide is serious. Help tell people like Kyle it's not a joke.
"
21,2,Shopper,"Hey, good for you guys, trying to help. 
"
21,2,Cartman,"Yeah, make sure everyone you know gets involved or else I'm gonna do it.
"
21,2,Heidi,"We're getting a lot of attention, Eric. Our Web site's already full of kids saying they feel the same way as you, and want to get help.
"
21,2,Cartman,"They want to get help? For what?
"
21,2,Heidi,"For... wanting to take their own lives.
"
21,2,Cartman,"No, this is about me killing myself.
"
21,2,Heidi,"But babe, there's a lot of kids who feel the same way you do.
"
21,2,Cartman,"They're full of shit, Heidi. They're just trying to get attention. What, are you actually talking online to these ass wipes?!
"
21,2,Heidi,"I thought this was about raising awareness and helping people.
"
21,2,Cartman,"So you're just gonna e-mail with every guy who has a dick and a death wish?! Are we just your type?!
"
21,2,Heidi,"Eric, come on.
"
21,2,Cartman,"No, look, Heidi. I'm sorry, but you're the one who started all this by telling everybody that I was suicidal! Okay?! Now I'm under a lot of pressure to do it! So the only option I have is to make sure that suicide prevention becomes this entire town's number one priority! 
"
21,2,Driver 2," Oh God, did you see what the President said about Asians now?
"
21,2,Husband,"Look out! 
"
21,2,Cartman,"Oh, are you freaking serious?!
"
21,2,Craig,"Okay, babe, what do you want to ride first?
"
21,2,Tweek,"Ugh! What are we doing here, Craig?!
"
21,2,Craig,"We're gonna get your mind off politics and have some fun. Now, what's your favorite ride?
"
21,2,Tweek," The Ferris wheel!!
"
21,2,Craig,"Isn't this lovely, Tweek? Just look at that view!
"
21,2,Tweek," Oh God! Another tweet from the President!
"
21,2,Craig,"Oh, come on.
"
21,2,Tweek,"""Why would the U.S. be scared of North Korea? Tweek is so not scared he's at an amusement park in Denver right now.""  JESUS CHRIST, WE'VE GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE!!
"
21,2,Craig,"Tweek! Tweek, use your brain! North Korea isn't going to attack an amusement park. You're safer here than anywhere.
"
21,2,Father,"Oh, Jeez, the President just called Kim Jong-un a fat midget.  Oh, and now North Korea is saying that they're gonna-
"
21,2,Son,"Dad, look out! 
"
21,2,Father,"Oh, shit! 
"
21,2,Attendant,"All right everyone, please wait for your bumper cars to come to a complete stop. We hope you enjoyed Crazy Cars- 
"
21,2,Daughter,"Mommy, look out! 
"
21,2,Tweek," Oh my God, what is that? What is that?!
"
21,2,Craig,"It's probably nothing. Everything's fine.
"
21,2,Tweek,"Will you please stop saying that?! I can't take it!
"
21,2,Craig,"I'm trying to make you feel better.
"
21,2,Tweek,"Well, maybe I don't wanna feel better right now!
"
21,2,Craig,"Okay, but think about that. That actually doesn't make any sense.
"
21,2,Tweek,"Why do you have to be so logical?! I don't need you to problem-solve all the time, I need you to... Augh, I don't know!
"
21,2,Craig,"Tweek, honey, all week you've been freaking out, and I've been the one forced to deal with it!
"
21,2,Tweek,"You haven't been dealing with it, you've been trying to make it go away because my emotions are freaking you out! 
"
21,2,Craig,"Tweek, North Korea isn't bombing anyone.  They would lose the support of China, and that would mean-
"
21,2,Tweek,"There you go again! Stop preaching facts to me! It's not what I need!
"
21,2,Craig,"Well, I'm sorry that I'm actually in control of my goddamn emotions, you baby!  Oh, see? Now you made me lose control of my emotions.  God dammit! 
"
21,2,Butters,"Hey Craig, how come Tweek's not at school?
"
21,2,Craig," How should I know?
"
21,2,Jimmy,"Uh oh, trouble in paradise?
"
21,2,Craig,"Look guys, Tweek doesn't want help, okay? He just wants to overreact.
"
21,2,Henry Kline," Hey guys, can we have your attention? Tomorrow night we'll be having a memorial service for all the students we've lost to distracted driving. We hope you can all bring your families.
"
21,2,Cartman," Cool, yeah. Hey guys, and there's also gonna be a suicide awareness pot luck at 7:30 tomorrow night in the school gymnasium. We're gonna have lots of games and face-painting, and uh, what are you guys gonna have?
"
21,2,Henry,"...Uhw-we're gonna have some guest speakers and also provide grievance counselors for those who need it.
"
21,2,Cartman,"Yeah, grievance counseling, that sounds super fun. Listen guys, there's a very real chance I might actually do it right in front of everyone tomorrow, so you don't want to miss it. Suicide prevention pot luck, everybody.
"
21,2,Heidi," Eric, you need to stop. What they're doing is important.
"
21,2,Cartman,"They're doing a memorial service with speeches and crying. What's that gonna solve?
"
21,2,Heidi,"It's not about problem-solving, Eric. It's about people getting together and feeling what they need to feel.  People need help sorting out their emotions sometimes. And the best thing isn't always quick answers, but just being there, supporting each other and... talking through those feelings.
"
21,2,Cartman,"You are so up and down. I don't know what you want from me, Heidi!
"
21,2,Heidi," Come on, there has to be a way we can all work together here.
"
21,2,Cartman,"So now you're on their side! Oh my God, I'm seriously gonna do it right now! 
"
21,2,Heidi,"Eric! 
"
21,2,Craig," Tweek, what's going on??
"
21,2,Tweek,"What? What do you mean, what's going on?! The same shit that's been going on!
"
21,2,Craig,"Nothing's gotten any better? Oh my God, how does that make you feel?
"
21,2,Tweek,"I feel scared! I feel alone!
"
21,2,Craig,"Well that must be horrible to feel that way. It must be hard for you to even think!
"
21,2,Tweek,"It is!  It's terrible!
"
21,2,Craig,"I bet it's terrible! What else are you feeling?
"
21,2,Tweek,"Like, like I have no control over my life. Like I'm just a pawn in a big game.
"
21,2,Craig,"Oh, that's a terrifying thought. You must feel trapped.
"
21,2,Tweek,"Yeah, like trapped, but like, completely unable to even move.
"
21,2,Craig,"Jesus, it's like there's no solution to any of this! What are you gonna do?? What can you do?
"
21,2,Tweek,"I don't know, it's... it's like... maybe, maybe I have to find a way to feel a little in charge of me again.
"
21,2,Craig,"That sounds so insurmountable though. How would you even start?
"
21,2,Tweek,"I don't know, but I I've gotta do something about this. There's gotta be a way I can...  Thank you, Craig.  I've got it. People aren't focused on the right thing. I know what I should do.
"
21,2,PC Principal,"All right everyone, listen up. Tonight, one of our students has put together a song about a very important issue. It's a song about how there are certain times to not be on your phone. I hope you all listen carefully. 
"
21,2,Craig,"
People are dying. The fault is our own.
You can do lots of damage when you're on your phone.
We all have to agree to change it somehow.
Let's all make a pledge to end it right now.


"
21,2,Fourth grade choir,"
Put it down. Don't be on your phone while being President.
Put it down. You might do something dumb and cause an accident.


"
21,2,Townsfolk,"
 Let's all agree, here today, that if we're leader of the U.S.A.


"
21,2,The parents,"
We'll put it down


"
21,2,The Governor,"If at any point today you're being a President, put down your mobile device.
"
21,2,Fourth grade choir,"
Put it down.


"
21,2,Townsman,"If I'm on the phone, I will not get behind the... desk of an oval office.
"
21,2,Fourth grade choir,"
Put it down.


"
21,2,McDonald's worker,"I'll take the pledge!
"
21,2,Doctor,"I'll take the pledge.
"
21,2,Hillary Clinton,"And I'll take the pledge.
"
21,2,Fourth grade choir,"
No one cares.


"
21,2,Diner,"What's that? I was just elected President? Well then, goodbye!
"
21,2,Fourth grade choir,"
Put it down if you're President today.


"
21,2,The parents,"
If you find yourself being President today.


"
21,2,Fourth grade choir,"
Ah ah ah, ah a-aaah.


"
21,2,Nancy,"Hey, Brian, look! I was just elected President.
"
21,2,Brian,"That's great, Nancy. Now put down your phone.
"
21,2,Nancy,"Right.
"
21,2,Fourth grade choir,"
Ah ah ah, ah a-aaah, aaah. Put it down.


"
21,2,Cartman,"

Give a standing ovation for suicide in our nation
Or I will rip my own guts out without one hesitation 
Dedication, that's what it's taken to awaken people to care 
And yet my future's so hazy, my girlfriend's makin' me crazy
But still I'm workin' so hard. You know, just tryin' to hold on, 
'Cause I know that you'd all miss me so much if I was gone. 
And all the voices start solo, but every day I hear them grow.
Sayiin' ""Eric, don't do it! Don't do it! Noooo (noooo, noooo)""


"
21,2,Choir and parents,"

Put it down. Don't be on your phone while being president.
Put it down. You might do something dumb and cause an accident.
We all agree, here today, that if we're leader of the U.S.A.
We'll put it down 


"
21,2,Fourth grade choir,"
Put it down. 


"
21,2,Cartman," I'm not gonna do it, you guys! It worked! I'm not gonna do it!
"
21,3,Cartman," This is an outrage! This is a violation of our human rights! 
"
21,3,Stan,"What the hell is going on?
"
21,3,Cartman,"You didn't hear the announcement? They just cancelled Columbus Day! We have to come to school on Monday!
"
21,3,Kyle,"They what??
"
21,3,Butters," They can't do this! We made plans! 
"
21,3,Cartman,"Some asshole went and convinced the school board that Columbus Day is racist and should be eliminated!
"
21,3,Butters," You can't take away a day off! We're just innocent children!
"
21,3,Stan,"Dude, what asshole would take away a holiday?
"
21,3,Peter Galtman,"My name is Peter Galtman. I am the head of the school calendar committee.  I've decided that school will not celebrate Columbus Day this year. I realize this is a hot-button issue for many families, but one parent in particular has really swayed my opinion with his passion. Mr. Randy Marsh. Mr. Marsh pointed out to me the hypocrisy of glorifying a genocidal murderer, and Mr. Marsh is right now also working on having the Columbus statue taken down in Canyon City.
"
21,3,Randy," Come on, everybody! Let's take this fuckin' thing down!  Yeah, yehah!  Take it down! Columbus was a mass murderer!  Tear it down! Tear it down! Yeah!  Hey, it's not working.  We almost got it, guys! Come on, throw the rope, Stan!  Good, that's good! Hit the gas, Nelson!  We got it, everybody! To hell with you, Columbus! You guh-whoa! Whoa! 
"
21,3,Stan,"Hey dude.
"
21,3,Kyle,"Dude! Did you know it's your dad did who's getting the school to cancel Columbus Day?
"
21,3,Stan,"Yeah. Dude, I don't know what's going on. He's really serious about this.
"
21,3,Kyle,"Well, you've gotta do something. If you get him to back down, maybe the school will reconsider.
"
21,3,Stan,"I can't get him to back down.
"
21,3,Kyle,"Stan, I have to deal with my mom doing shit like this all the time, but she's never tried to take away a holiday. I'm your best friend, but I can't have your back when the guys find out about this.
"
21,3,Stan,"I'll try, okay.  Ok-I, I gotta go. 
"
21,3,Randy,"Okay, Stan, you got your phone? I need to call everyone on this list. They all live in the same city.
"
21,3,Stan,"Dad, listen: you need to ease off a little here.
"
21,3,Randy,"Stan, it's not right that people celebrate a man who wiped out millions of people for his own glory!  Let's go!  Hello? Is this uh  Howard Peterson? You live in Columbus, Ohio, is that correct? Yeah? You racist piece of shit. You heard me. You're an intolerant pig. Oh, you're not? You just choose to live in a city named for ethnic cleansing. No, fuck you! Rename your city, asshole! Hello?  Okay, next one, come on. Get calling, Stan!
"
21,3,Stan,"Dad, come on. We all get your point, but don't you think you're overdoing it?
"
21,3,Randy,"You have to overdo it in today's society Stan. You can't be nuanced and subtle anymore or else critics go ""Wow, what was the point of that?""  Hi, Francis Melman? Hey, how are you, you fuckin' racist?
"
21,3,Field Reporter," Christopher Columbus. Explorer, pioneer. Is he someone who should be appreciated, or was he just a douche? For years, Columbus Circle has been a landmark and photogenic intersection in New York City. So it came as a surprise when someone defecated on the statue earlier today. I'm joined now by the man who did the actual defecating, Mr. Randy Marsh of South Park, Colorado. 
"
21,3,Randy,"Good evening.
"
21,3,Field Reporter,"Mr. Marsh, you took a dump on a beloved statue that's been an icon here in the city for years. What was your reasoning?
"
21,3,Randy,"Well, I just have a problem with the racist people of this city. Yeehaw,  I'm from New York! I drive around a big circle n' celebrates a guy who murdered Native Americans! Shoowee!
"
21,3,Field Reporter,"So you're doing this because of indigenous peoples and their feelings.
"
21,3,Randy,"I don't care if people get indigenous, I'll crap all over their statues! I'm the one who's indigenous that this landmark even exists!
"
21,3,Field Reporter,"Aah, aaah, bah, back to you, Tom.
"
21,3,Butters,"It ain't right. They make you work like a dog and then they just tear away your one day off in October like you're a piece of trash!
"
21,3,Stan," Hey guys. 
"
21,3,Cartman,"Boo! Boo! Nobody likes you, Stan!
"
21,3,Stan,"Look, I tried talking to him, alright? He's just really against all the things Columbus did.
"
21,3,Jimmy,"Does anyone know what Columbus actually did?
"
21,3,Cartman,"Yeah. In fourteen hundred ninety-two, Columbus got us a day off skewl. That's what matters.
"
21,3,Kyle,"No! No, wait guys. Maybe that's it. When I'm dealing with my mom, sometimes it works to be on her side for a minute. Maybe we should find out all the things people find offensive about Columbus and-
"
21,3,Cartman,"And totally act like we care. I like it, Kyle.
"
21,3,Kyle,"I'll just look up Columbus, offensive, inflammatory-
"
21,3,Cartman,"Yeah, this is sweet. It's like that movie where the dude pretended to be on the monsters' side? You know, with the guy and the chick that had the wife beater on, but her boobs were sweaty so you could see them? 
"
21,3,Butters,"I love that movie.
"
21,3,Cartman,"Yeah, this is a lot like that. What'd you find, Kyle?
"
21,3,Kyle,"Nnnothing.
"
21,3,Butters,"Dang it! There's nothing?
"
21,3,Kyle,"Stan, can I talk to you for a minute? 
"
21,3,Cartman," What? What? What the hell was that?
"
21,3,Stan,"Hey Dad?
"
21,3,Randy,"Not now, Stan. I'm working on a proposal to change British Columbia to just British.
"
21,3,Stan,"But Dad, Kyle found a picture on Instagram.  It pretty much looks like you dressed as Columbus at a Halloween party. 
"
21,3,Randy,"Where did you get that?
"
21,3,Stan,"If you hate Columbus so much, why did you dress like him?
"
21,3,Randy,"Look, that was a long time ago, okay? It's just a dumb Halloween costume.
"
21,3,Stan,"Yeah but,  here's you dressed as Columbus at a formal dinner, and here's you dressed as Columbus at a football game, and you as Columbus on St. Patrick's Day...
"
21,3,Randy,"Look, I was younger! We were all... younger. It was another time. You have to understand, it was 2013. Everyone was stoked on Columbus back then.
"
21,3,Stan,"Yeah, but Dad, you seem to be really stoked on Columbus.
"
21,3,Randy,"If you guys found those pictures online, it's only a matter of time before everyone else does. People won't care about what I do now. They'll just see me as a thoughtless, indigenous son of a bitch.
"
21,3,Sharon,"Randy, do you mind cleaning out the garage like I asked?
"
21,3,Randy," What's the point, Sharon? Soon they're gonna be coming after me.
"
21,3,Sharon,"Ach. 
"
21,3,Announcer," Hey, you! That's right, you! Wouldn't you like to know the story of you? What makes you you? DNAandMe is a genetic service that can help you find out exactly who your ancestors were. You might be surprised.
"
21,3,Cyclist," I thought I was just a standard white guy, but DNAandMe showed that I'm actually 4.2% Cherokee Indian.
"
21,3,Woman 1," Turns out I'm not totally white. I'm also part Northern Asian and even some Kurdish. I'm a victim of oppression. 
"
21,3,Steve," I used to get in trouble for always using the N word. But with DNAandMe I found out that I'm 2.1% black.
"
21,3,Office Worker," 'Morning, Steve?
"
21,3,Steve,"Sup, n*gga? 
"
21,3,Announcer,"The test is easy.  Simply swab the inside of your mouth and send it into our lab.
"
21,3,Driver," People made fun of me for being French. DNAandMe showed I was 8% Navajo. Nobody's makin' fun of me now, or my people, who are victims.
"
21,3,Female Jogger,"I'm 13% victim.
"
21,3,Painter,"I'm 21% victim.
"
21,3,Announcer,"Order now and find out if your friends should be more sympathetic towards you. DNAandMe. Are you in?
"
21,3,Randy,"Hell fucking yes I'm in.
"
21,3,Randy,"Alright, everyone's here. Let's do this.  Here you go, just like I said. A hundred dollars cash. No questions asked. Are we good?  Good. No talking. Perfect. Okay, let's get this over with.  Thank you. Do not talk of this to anyone. 
"
21,3,Randy,"All right, everybody. Hey, thanks for comin'. If uh-I can have your attention, please? I think we're ready to get started.
"
21,3,DNA test administrator," Ahah, Mr. Marsh, you know, none of this was really necessary. For DNAandMe testing you can just swab the inside of your mouth yourself and send it in the mail.
"
21,3,Randy,"Yeah, I know, but I just, I was really excited, wanted everyone to witness my test.
"
21,3,DNA test administrator,"Well, to each their own I suppose.  All right, open wide.  Okay, I'll get this back to the lab and get the results to you as quickly as possible.
"
21,3,Randy,"Okay, great. I'm very interested to see  what those results have to say.
"
21,3,Peter Galtman," Galtman residence.
"
21,3,Masked voice,"Listen to me carefully. The man who convinced you to cancel Columbus Day is a fraud.
"
21,3,Mr. Galtman,"Who is this?
"
21,3,Masked voice,"You will go online and search Instagram for images of Randy Marsh.
"
21,3,Mr. Galtman,"I most certainly will not!
"
21,3,Masked voice,"Randy Marsh is a hypocrite and a fake. You will be taken down with him when he is exposed! 
"
21,3,Kyle,"What's he saying?
"
21,3,Kenny,"(Shhh! Don't interrupt!)  We know where you live and we know how to make you suffer!
"
21,3,Mr. Galtman,"Now you listen here, Mr. Man! The Galtmans don't believe in social media or the Internet! It's all fake news!
"
21,3,Mrs. Galtman,"Fake news.
"
21,3,Kenny," Then speak with Marsh yourself! The truth is out there!  (Well, I don't know if that worked.)
"
21,3,Mr. Galtman,"Hm.  Sounds like maybe the Galtmans need to check out Randy Marsh.
"
21,3,Randy,"Shelly! We've got an emergency! We're getting rid of all the Columbus stuff in this house! Any Columbus costumes? Columbus pictures? They all gotta go!
"
21,3,Shelly,"I don't give a shit about Columbus.
"
21,3,Randy,"Sharon! Peter Galtman called! He sounds suspicious! We've gotta get rid of all our Columbus shot glasses and coffee cups! Where are they?!
"
21,3,Sharon,"YOUR Columbus shot glasses and coffee cups are in that cupboard.
"
21,3,Randy,"Shot, shot glasses, coffee cups, towels, plates. What about the Columbus figurine salt and pepper shakers?
"
21,3,Sharon,"I don't know where YOU put them, Randy.
"
21,3,Randy," Sharon, do you know what they'll do to us when they find out how we were so stoked on Columbus??
"
21,3,Sharon,"YOU were stoked on Columbus, Randy. Not me.
"
21,3,Randy,"Oho, really?! Did you forget our wedding?! That's you, right there!  Standing there with a big smile on your face! You didn't say anything about it being insensitive then, did you?!
"
21,3,Sharon,"I actually was a little upset that you dressed up as Columbus for our wedding, but I decided-
"
21,3,Randy," Oh, NOW! You say that NOW 'cause everyone's freakin' out, but you were right there going along with it!  They're gonna be coming after you too, Sharon! So you can just wipe that indigenous look off your face!  Oh! That could be my DNA results! Here, take this stuff out back!  Oh... nooo, nonononono.
"
21,3,Bill,"I've never felt so alive until now.
"
21,3,Randy,"Thank you. Lo-lovely flowers. Thank, thank you. 
"
21,3,Mr. Galtman," Galtman residence.
"
21,3,Kenny," Listen carefully if you want to live. You will make this Monday a school holiday.
"
21,3,Mr. Galtman,"I spoke with Mr. Marsh and he denied any wrongdoing.
"
21,3,Kenny," Of course he did! That's what liars do!
"
21,3,Stan,"I don't think you're being intimidating enough.
"
21,3,Cartman,"Yeah, get meaner, Kenny.
"
21,3,Kenny,"Meaner like now, dude?
"
21,3,Stan,"I don't know, like, like uh, maybe say-
"
21,3,Cartman,"Just talk about cutting off his dick or something.
"
21,3,Kenny," We're gonna cut off your dick!
"
21,3,Kyle,"No dude, that's too far.
"
21,3,Cartman,"Okay, okay, just say we're gonna cut off part of his dick.
"
21,3,Stan,"Just give me the phone! Hello!
"
21,3,Mr. Galtman,"What?
"
21,3,Stan,"Randy Marsh is about to pay for what he's done!  Protect him and you will pay too! Time is running out!  Jesus!
"
21,3,Randy,"Sharon, have you seen my Columbus staff and orb?
"
21,3,Sharon,"I have not. 
"
21,3,Randy,"Sharon, Galtman called again. Somebody's out there trying to get me in trouble!
"
21,3,Sharon,"Randy, why don't you just admit to people that maybe you were somewhat overly excited about Columbus in the past?
"
21,3,Randy,"Everyone was excited about Columbus! For some reason people are just pointing fingers at me! Just because he's suddenly not cool now doesn't mean I'm gonna be the effin' scapegoat! 
"
21,3,Randy,"I've gotta burn this stuff!  Oh Goddamnit!
"
21,3,Bill,"I wrote you a song to express my feelings for you.
"
21,3,Randy,"Will you get out of here?!
"
21,3,Bill," And then he kissed me.
"
21,3,Randy," I didn't kiss you 'cause I liked you!
"
21,3,Bill," And then he kissed me.
"
21,3,Randy,"Okay, okay
"
21,3,Bill," And the sun began to shine.
"
21,3,Randy,"That's it! Get off my property! 
"
21,3,Bill,"Randy, I cannot quit you.
"
21,3,Randy,"Get off my land, you piece of shit! 
"
21,3,Bill,"Uuugh! 
"
21,3,Randy,"Don't post that.  Do not. Post that.  Shit!
"
21,3,Cartman,"Guys, what are you going?
"
21,3,Butters,"It's over, Eric. We have to come to school on Monday. Just face it.
"
21,3,Cartman,"I'm not facing anything. We still have time. There has to be a way-
"
21,3,Kyle,"Dude, there's nothing we can do, all right?
"
21,3,Cartman,"Oh okay. I see. Is that what Columbus did? Just give up? On his dream? No! Columbus believed that kids should have a day off skewl! And even when his own country wouldn't support his cause, Columbus said ""Fine! I'll go find a new land, where kids can have that day off!""
"
21,3,Jimmy,"Eric, just l-let it go.
"
21,3,Cartman,"And when Columbus sailed to distant places only to find people already there who said ""No! Stay off our land! We want our kids to have to go to skewl!"", he said ""No! It's just one day in October! They need a break!""

You guys can all give up, but I'm not.
Because in 1492, Columbus got us all a day off skewl.
With just three ships he sailed over so we could have some me time in October.
And yes, millions were slaughtered and throats were cut
But if we don't get that day off of school, then... for what?


"
21,3,Kyle,"Come on, guys.  There's something else we can try.
"
21,3,Randy," Sharon, good news!
"
21,3,Sharon,"What??
"
21,3,Randy,"The people from the DNA test called. They're on their way over. You wanna come down?
"
21,3,Sharon,"I'm doing something.
"
21,3,Randy,"You sure? These results could be really interesting. 
"
21,3,Randy,"Oh Goddammit, what the hell do you want?
"
21,3,Bill,"I want you to stop running from yourself. We could be so happy. 
"
21,3,Randy,"Crap, it's them!  Just a second, be right there. Thanks!  Get over here! I don't have any feelings for you. Do you understand?!
"
21,3,Bill,"But Randy, what about the-
"
21,3,Randy," NO! No buts! There is nothing here! I'm not in love with you! Got it?!
"
21,3,Bill,"Yes. Yes, I understand.
"
21,3,Randy,"Good! Now leave!  Hi, sorry. You guys have my results?
"
21,3,DNA test administrator,"Well, Mr. Marsh, we came because there was an irregularity with your test.
"
21,3,Randy,"Well what? You found something there you didn't expect to find? What is it?
"
21,3,DNA test administrator,"Well it's just a little too odd. We need to do the test again.
"
21,3,Randy,"Do it again? That's not fair.
"
21,3,DNA test administrator,"Mr. Marsh, please. If we could have one more sample. We want to be absolutely sure of what we found.
"
21,3,Randy,"Agh-uh oh, okay, no problem.  Give me, give me one sec. I'll be right back.  Wait!  Wait!  Okay! Okay, all set. Let's do this. Aaaaa-
"
21,3,DNA test administrator,"Mr. Marsh, we were hoping to do a more precise test. It's better for harder cases like this, but... it is an anal swab this time. 
"
21,3,Randy,"An anal swab? Give me tuh, three minutes.  Hey, where'd you go? 
"
21,3,DNA test administrator,"Mr. Marsh, we're in a bit of a hurry, if you don't mind. 
"
21,3,Randy,"Oh, aw shit. 
"
21,3,Cartman," All right, it's clear. Bring him in. 
"
21,3,Kenny," Move your ass, Galtman!
"
21,3,Mr. Galtman,"This is a violation of my rights.
"
21,3,Stan,"Just shut up, and watch what someone posted on their Instagram!
"
21,3,Mr. Galtman,"I most certainly will not! If you want me to look at the Internet, I will die first. It's fake news!
"
21,3,Kyle," That's why we had it transferred to VHS.
"
21,3,Mr. Galtman,"Oh, VHS is fine.
"
21,3,Kenny,"Take off his blindfold. 
"
21,3,Mr. Galtman,"Hmmm...
"
21,3,DNA test administrator,"Oh, Mr. Marsh.
"
21,3,Randy,"Whoa, ha-hay.  How are you? 
"
21,3,DNA test administrator,"Good. Wha-what are you up to?
"
21,3,Randy,"Chillin', chillin'.
"
21,3,DNA test administrator,"Well, uhhh, we did get your DNA results back this morning. Would you like to go over them?
"
21,3,Randy,"Oh, you did? Oh, great. Sure, why not? Uh, I'm here. Huh let's uh, let's do that.
"
21,3,DNA test administrator,"N'all right Mr. Marsh, here's your DNAandMe portfolio.  This shows that we actually found a mix of a few things in you regional ancestry.
"
21,3,Randy," Really? Like Native American? Like a, like a little bit?
"
21,3,DNA test administrator,"Nno, we didn't find any trace of any Native American DNA in your test.
"
21,3,Randy,"Nnnuts! 
"
21,3,DNA test administrator,"But as you can see here , we found that you are about 43% Northern European, 37% Mediterranean, and 18% Southwest Asian. In fact, your genetic profile most closely matches  your standard Caucasian British person.
"
21,3,Randy," Awww.
"
21,3,DNA test administrator,"And, you might be interested to know that you're actually 2.8% Neanderthal, which is fairly high.
"
21,3,Randy,"Neander-thal? What the hell is that about?
"
21,3,DNA test administrator,"Well, the Neanderthals were actually a species that was wiped out by Homo sapiens.
"
21,3,Randy,"Wiped out? All of my people?
"
21,3,DNA test administrator,"Yes, but you see, because of some cross-breeding, some people like you still possess Neanderthal DNA. Isn't that interesting?
"
21,3,Randy,"Cross-breeding? You mean rape. You're telling me that my ancestors were raped, and then eradicated by you? You maniacs!  The earth wasn't big enough for Neanderthals, so your ancestors just got rid of them, huh?! Well TO HELL WITH ALL OF YOU!! 
"
21,3,Mr. Galtman,"Well well, Mr. Marsh. I'd like to have a word, please.
"
21,3,Randy," You find this funny, Galtman!
"
21,3,Mr. Galtman,"What'd I do?
"
21,3,Randy,"Nobody had the guts to tell me what happened to my people, huh? Get the hell out of here! 
"
21,3,Bill,"I brought my parents over so you could meet them.
"
21,3,Randy,"Waww God!
"
21,3,Bill,"Don't worry. My parents are very okay and cool with us.
"
21,3,Stan,"Who the hell is that?
"
21,3,Randy,"Yeah, sure! Everyone gang up on the Neanderthal! Isn't it funny!
"
21,3,Bill,"Randy, you must face who you are. Stop pretending, Randy. For once, just allow yourself to feel.
"
21,3,Randy," You're right.  You're right. It's only now, when everyone is being so indigenous to me, that I realized... how indigenous I've been acting all along. I thought being a victim would solve all my problems. But being a victim has a down side too.  Mr. Galtman, I haven't been honest. It's time for us all... to be honest.
"
21,3,Randy,"What is a holiday? It's a day off work, yes. A day off school. But holidays are also meant to be a time to reflect. Today, I'm happy to announce that the school calendar committee is reinstating the day off.  But instead of glorifying anyone, Let us make it a holiday about the negative feelings that we all sometimes feel. Say what we're really thinking so we can move on. And so, the second Monday in October will still be a holiday, but instead of Columbus Day, it will be for ripping on each other and tearing each other down. And we will call it Indigenous Peoples Day. For perhaps if we all do it at the same time, we won't be so indigenous the rest of the year. And since this is the second Monday of October, let's all embrace the new meaning of the holiday starting right now.
"
21,3,Dave,"Do you even know what indigenous means, you freakin' idiot?!
"
21,3,Randy,"That's the spirit, Dave. Come on, everybody, let's just all be totally indigenous. Come on!
"
21,3,Kurt,"Who the hell let this guy talk to the school council?
"
21,3,Randy,"Good one Kurt. Your wife's a whore. Come on, everyone! Indigenous People's Day! Let's go for it!
"
21,3,Woman 2,"Shut up and get off the podium! 
"
21,3,Randy,"Okay, I will in a second, fatso. All right, who else? Come on! Get it out of your system! Happy Indigenous People's Day, everyone. Suck my asshole!
"
21,4,Man 1,"What on Earth was that?
"
21,4,Jimmy," My name is Jimmy Valmer.  And I am very...  f-f-fast.  When I was born, my parents knew I was different.
"
21,4,Doctor," I'm sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Valmer, your newborn son will never be able to walk. But he will be extremely good at comedy. 
"
21,4,Baby Jimmy," Wow! What a teh-t-teh-terrific audience. 
"
21,4,Jimmy," As I got older, my powers only increased.
"
21,4,Jimmy," What do you call cheese that isn't yours?
"
21,4,Woman 1,"AAAAHHHH Help! 
"
21,4,Jimmy,"Nacho cheese. 
"
21,4,Jimmy," And now I look for others like me to fight crime as part of a superhero team. I am... Fas... Fastpass! 
"
21,4,Cartman," Okay, okay, thank you, Fastpass. What do you guys think?
"
21,4,Stan,"We definitely don't have anyone with superhuman speed in our franchise.
"
21,4,Tolkien,"Fastpass, what makes you feel... qualified to be part of our cinematic universe?
"
21,4,Jimmy,"Well, besides being super f-f-fa-fast, I also have a good attitude, and flexibility with my schedule on weekends.
"
21,4,Cartman,"Fastpass, welcome to Coon and Friends. You are about to make a shitload of money.
"
21,4,Cartman,"Alright, superheros, it's time to lay out our plan of action. As you can see, I have divided the franchise plan into three phases. Phase 1 begins with The Coon Netflix series and goes through the Coon and Friends United movie, where we introduce Toolshed and The Human Kite. In Phase 2 we do Coon vs. Fastpass followed by an origin movie about Mosquito.
"
21,4,Clyde,"Bzzz oh boy, I get my own origin movie, bzzz?
"
21,4,Cartman,"That's right. It's in Phase 2 that we introduce Tupperware, our black superhero, like an ace in the hole.
"
21,4,Stan,"Whoawhoa wait, how come we gotta start off with a Netflix series? Can't we just go right into movies?
"
21,4,Cartman,"Netflix is starving for new shows right now, Toolshed. They will literally buy anything people pitch them. We need to strike while the iron's hot. Later in Phase 3 we can finally get to Civil War, where we will all- 
"
21,4,Stan,"What is it?
"
21,4,Kyle,"Incoming Face Time call from Super Craig. 
"
21,4,Cartman,"Onscreen!
"
21,4,Craig,"You guys, we have a big problem.
"
21,4,Cartman,"What is it, Super Craig?
"
21,4,Craig,"Somebody's messing with our Facebook page. They're spreading all these lies, saying we like, burn the American flag and pee in each other's mouths.
"
21,4,Stan,"Spreading lies how?
"
21,4,Craig,"Take a look.  Someone is systematically targeting our Facebook followers and feeding them misinformation.
"
21,4,Cartman,"Who would deliberately use Facebook in such a horribly reckless way?
"
21,4,Stephen," Butters, you're not looking at boobies again, are you?
"
21,4,Butters,"No Dad, I'm not looking at boobies.  Waahahahahaha!
"
21,4,Cartman,"Butters?!
"
21,4,Butters,"Oh, hey fellas.
"
21,4,Cartman,"Butters, are you using Facebook to fuck with our superhero franchise?
"
21,4,Butters,"Uuuuuuummm, nope. 
"
21,4,Stan,"Butters? Butters!
"
21,4,Butters," Yes, fellas?
"
21,4,Stan,"Dude, listen. We don't have time for this. Right now, Netflix is buying any show that people pitch them. We have a real shot at starting our franchise, and you are a part of that franchise plan, okay? We have movies planned for the bad guy.
"
21,4,Butters,"You mean like Suicide Squad?
"
21,4,Stan,"Yes!
"
21,4,Butters," Suicide Squad sucked! 
"
21,4,Kyle,"Butters! Butters! You can't just make stuff up about us!  People are thinking it's true!
"
21,4,Butters,"Look fellas, you have a right to be on Facebook and I have a right to be on facebook. And sometimes that's going to cause a little...  CHAOS.  Gotta get to classss.
"
21,4,Kyle,"Dude, what a dick!
"
21,4,Cartman,"If we don't find a way to stop him, we're never gonna make any money, you guys.
"
21,4,Ryan,"Thanks for coming, everyone. I know you are all concerned as Sarah and I are about what's happening to our children.
"
21,4,Thomas,"I just... can't believe that children in our town are dressing up in hero costumes and peeing in each other's mouths.
"
21,4,Randy,"And who are these kids? Does anyone know? They're wearing capes and forcing objects into their own rectal cavities? Why?
"
21,4,Steve,"We  were shocked to read that a young African-American boy is wearing Tupperware and defecating on girls while they sleep. What if those kids are hanging out with our kids?
"
21,4,Stephen,"You know what I think the problem is? Facebook.
"
21,4,Randy,"Facebook? How so?
"
21,4,Stephen,"Well, look, we all know there's a lot of mixing of truth and fiction that's been on Facebook lately, and children lack the cognitive ability to determine what's true and what isn't on Facebook. That's why we now have young kids dressing up in costumes, eating poop, and having sex with antelopes in our town.
"
21,4,Thomas,"Maybe we need to get our kids off of Facebook.
"
21,4,Randy,"That'll never happen. You know what I say we do? Let's invite Mark Zuckerberg to come and talk to us all about our concerns in this community.
"
21,4,Linda,"Do you really think he'd come?
"
21,4,Stephen,"Why not give it a try? Let's invite Mark Zuckerberg here and see what he has to say? I'm sure he's a reasonable person. 
"
21,4,Butters," Who are you?! What do you want?!
"
21,4,Adam,"I'm here about the job? 
"
21,4,Butters,"Oh. Are you Adam? Well, come on in.  You're making a smart career choice, Adam. You see, what we do here is utilize Facebook not only to spread chaos, but to actually profit from it. You'll find the hours very reasonable and I'm working on getting full health and dental for all employees.  Here's your company uniform. You see, what I've done, Adam, is build a completely self-sustaining Chaos machine  - You look fantastic - doing nothing more than what Facebook was designed to do. I make money from Facebook for my fake content in order to pay Facebook to promote my fake stories. And thusly we're growing bigger every day. Everyone, can I have your attention please?  We have a new agent in Chaos. Please welcome Adam Borque.  Here you go. You can take this workstation, Adam. Just start writing horrible things about people and presenting it as reality on Facebook. Alright! Don't forget we have a Chaos quota, gang! Let's really fuck shit up! 
"
21,4,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, alright, can everyone hear me in the back? Hm'kay, we're gonna get started here. I know you all have a lot of questions, so without further ado, let me introduce Mark Zuckerberg.  Thanks for coming, Mr. Zuckerberg.
"
21,4,Mark," Thank you. It is a great honor to be here amongst all of you. 
"
21,4,Mr. Mackey,"For those of you who don't know uh, could you tell us who you are?
"
21,4,Mark,"I am the founder and chairman of Facebook. But I also have a shtoile that is completely unblockable.
"
21,4,Mr. Mackey,"Okay, we'll let him speak and then we'll uh open the floor to some questions if there's time, thank you.
"
21,4,Mark,"Thank you, right?  Alright, everyone here wants to see my shtoile. But first, what I'll need is a volunteer. Yes, you sir.
"
21,4,Man 2,"Mr. Zuckerberg, Facebook has become a tool for some to disrupt our country and our community.
"
21,4,Mark,"You say these things like they are my fault, and yet they are not.
"
21,4,Man 2,"Well, you did create a platform with a monetary incentive for people to spread misinformation?
"
21,4,Mark,"Ha ha ha ha ha! Now I see you're trying to use your shtoile over mine. Now, you try to block me.  Now you've learned that you cannot block me, yehhhs?  Yes, what is your question?
"
21,4,Woman 2," How are we supposed to keep our kids-? 
"
21,4,Cartman,"Wilson Aubrey?
"
21,4,Wilson,"Yeah.
"
21,4,Cartman,"It's us, your heroes, Coon and Friends. We're uhm, just wondering why you stopped following us on Instagram?
"
21,4,Wilson,"Because you victimize innocent people and poop in little girls' mouths.
"
21,4,Cartman,"That's not true, Wilson. We're Coon and Friends, not Harvey Weinstein.
"
21,4,Wilson,"Facebook says it's true.
"
21,4,Cartman,"But it's NOT true.
"
21,4,Wilson,"But Facebook says it's true.
"
21,4,Cartman," Okay, but it's NOT true, and you need to have your own fucking brain and decide shit for yourself!
"
21,4,Wilson,"AAAAH! 
"
21,4,Cartman,"God dammit! Let's just face it! We're never gonna have a superhero franchise!
"
21,4,Kyle,"It's so unfair.
"
21,4,Jimmy,"Come on, fellas. Wu-we can't let Butters win.
"
21,4,Cartman,"Forget it, Fastpass. The world hates us now.
"
21,4,Stan,"Yeah, nobody believes in us.
"
21,4,Jimmy,"W-we believe in each other, don't we?  Who cares what everyone else thinks? I joined this franchise because I believe that it can make a lot of money. And being a superhero means you keep believing in that money, no matter how hard things get!
"
21,4,Cartman,"Fastpass is right. We let all this distract us from what's important. We just need to get the Netflix series and let our superhero franchise speak for itself!
"
21,4,Kyle,"Coon, everybody hates us.
"
21,4,Cartman,"Maybe so, but we know who we are! We are Coon Friends because we care about each other. Because we have each other's back! And when things look their darkest, these heroes will stand together!  And we'll-!
"
21,4,Heidi,"Hey babe, what's up?  What are you up to?
"
21,4,Cartman," Nothing, just fucking wearing sweet costumes and talking about fighting evil, is that okay?
"
21,4,Heidi,"I just- I thought we were meeting at the park. You didn't text or anything.
"
21,4,Cartman," Oh my God, are you fucking kidding me right now?
"
21,4,Heidi,"Sorry! I won't interrupt! 
"
21,4,Cartman,"Because we are Coon and Friends, and as long as we have each other, we can do anything!
"
21,4,Richard,"I swear, that was the worst public speaker I've ever seen. What was Mark Zuckerberg's point?
"
21,4,Mrs. Tweak,"I don't even understand what that was about.
"
21,4,Richard,"Guess nobody realized that Mark Zuckerberg was such a penis.
"
21,4,Richard,"What the hell?
"
21,4,Mrs. Tweak,"It's Mark Zuckerberg.
"
21,4,Richard,"I know who it is!  Excuse me, what are you doing here?!
"
21,4,Mark,"I was invited here by people.
"
21,4,Richard,"We invited you to come speak to our community about our problems!
"
21,4,Mark," Ah, I see what you did there. Trying to block me, riiight? I'm tired of eating chips. What else is there? 
"
21,4,Richard,"Hey! Get out of our fridge!
"
21,4,Mark,"Ha ha ha, this puny refrigerator could not block me. What makes you think you can?
"
21,4,Richard,"Now you listen here! I will not-! 
"
21,4,Mark,"Ha ha ha ha, you are no match for my shtoile.
"
21,4,Mark,"So, where are we headed? Perhaps we should get some food.
"
21,4,Stephen,"What, eh. Excuse me, this is our car?!
"
21,4,Mark,"You call this a car? It wasn't even remotely able to block me. What is this car's shtoile?
"
21,4,Stephen,"Get, get out of here, ya penis.
"
21,4,Mark,"Ha ha ha ha. You say I am a penis and yet I am not a penis.


"
21,4,Operator 1,"Netflix, you're greenlit. Who am I speaking with?
"
21,4,Cartman," Uh yes, hello. We have an idea for a show that we think would be great for Netflix.
"
21,4,Operator 1,"Okay, great. Would you like a pilot or just go straight to an order of six episodes?
"
21,4,Cartman,"We'd like to go right into six episodes with a pickup option at the end of three.
"
21,4,Operator 1,"Got it. Can you start shooting next month?
"
21,4,Operator 2,"Got a show about transsexual dragons here.
"
21,4,Cartman,"Yes. We are ready to start right now. We are very, very excited.
"
21,4,Operator 1,"Okay, sounds great, we'll send you the contracts. Oh, and uh, what's the show about?
"
21,4,Cartman,"It's a stand-alone series about a superhero called the Coon before he joins Coon and Friends.
"
21,4,Operator 1,"Coon and Friends? You mean, the kids I just read about in the news who stabbed Jessica Alba?
"
21,4,Cartman,"Look, you didn't, you didn't read that on the news you read that on Facebook!
"
21,4,Stan,"Aw man, here we go.
"
21,4,Operator 1,"Yeah, ah, dangit, we've never done this before, but I'm afraid I'm gonna have to pass on your show.
"
21,4,Cartman,"Listen to me! There are falsehoods about us on Facebook that are NOT TRUE!
"
21,4,Operator 1,"Well then, you should have those things taken down. It can't be that hard.
"
21,4,Cartman,"It's a lot harder than you think!
"
21,4,Operator 1,"L-look, we'd love to approve your show, but you need to get those things cleared up first, okay? Thanks for calling.  Netflix, you're greenlit. Who am I speaking with?
"
21,4,Elderly Man,"What the? Who are you?
"
21,4,Elderly Woman,"I believe that's Mark Zuckerberg.
"
21,4,Elderly Man,"Hey that's my soup!
"
21,4,Mark," So, you are trying to block me, huh? That's fine. What's your shtoile?
"
21,4,Elderly Man,"I don't have a shtoile.
"
21,4,Ryan,"Hey! Get out of my bed!
"
21,4,Mark,"I was invited here. I am only making use of a bed for sleeping, yehhhs?
"
21,4,Ryan,"We just wanted you to come share your insights on Facebook!
"
21,4,Mark," Oh, my head, my head.  You should have worked with me when you had the chance. Now you lie over there, dead.
"
21,4,Butters,"Attention employees. Kelly Shmidt has just written her 100th fake blog post that was shared over a thousand times on Facebook. Let's hear it for Kelly!  Don't forget about those Chaos incentives! You too can benefit from pandemonium. 
"
21,4,Cartman,"Butters!
"
21,4,Adam,"Whoa no, it's Coon and Friends! 
"
21,4,Chaos #35,"Oh no!
"
21,4,Butters,"Calm down, everyone. Stick to your work. I will deal with these trespassers.
"
21,4,Kyle,"We're here to put an end to you, Chaos!
"
21,4,Cartman,"Yeah! I don't have buttsex with antelopes and Tolkien doesn't poop in girls' mouths!
"
21,4,Butters,"It's the 21st century, gentlemen! There's nothing illegal about what I'm doing.
"
21,4,Jimmy,"Yeah? Nothing illegal about us kicking your ah...ass either.
"
21,4,Butters,"Actually, that IS illegal. And besides, you can't do anything to me. 
"
21,4,Mark,"Bwaaaaaa! So, this is the Coon and Friends that you have told me about.  I warn you, my fighting shtoile is unsurpassed.
"
21,4,Jimmy,"Who the ss-Sam Hell is th-that?
"
21,4,Clyde,"I think that's Mark Zuckerberg.
"
21,4,Mark,"You want to get to Butters, riiight? You're gonna have to get through me, huuuh?!
"
21,4,Stan,"Dude, this kid is deliberately lying about us on your platform for no other reason than to cause harm! Why are you protecting him?!
"
21,4,Mark,"Simple. He paid me $17.23.
"
21,4,Butters,"It's the Facebook Safeguard program. Just $17 monthly gets you personal protection from Mark Zuckerberg.
"
21,4,Mark,"Come on! What's your shtoile?
"
21,4,Sgt. Yates,"Alright, alright, everyone calm down! I can't hear over all of you. 
"
21,4,Stephen,"You have to do something! This guy's goin' around acting like everyone's stuff is his!
"
21,4,Thomas,"I'm sick of getting out of the shower to find Mark Zuckerberg sitting on my toilet!
"
21,4,Steve,"Zuckerberg ate everything in our freezer and then helped himself to my wife's lubricant! 
"
21,4,Sgt. Yates,"Alright, everyone, I just want to know one thing. Who invited him here?  Come on. Who invited Mark Zuckerberg to town in the first place? 
"
21,4,Randy,"We did. 
"
21,4,Sgt. Yates,"Huh? What's that?
"
21,4,Randy,"We invited Mark Zuckerberg to town.
"
21,4,Sgt. Yates,"Uh huh, that's what I thought. You all brought Mark Zuckerberg into your lives and now you want the police to shoot him.
"
21,4,Stephen,"Please, you don't understand! He-h he's such a penis!
"
21,4,Thomas,"Yeah, and I'm pretty sure his voice is dubbed and he does all his own sound effects.
"
21,4,Sgt. Yates,"Well that doesn't mean he's done anything illegal. Now, the police will help deal with Mark Zuckerberg, but we aren't going to shoot him.
"
21,4,The crowd,"Awwwwww!
"
21,4,Sgt. Yates,"I'm sorry, that's just the way it is. You all should've thought harder about this before letting him into your lives.
"
21,4,Cartman,"When we all became superheroes, we took an oath. that no matter what it took, we would all make shitloads of money. But thanks to Mark Zuckerberg, right now, we are a superhero group that can't even get a show on Netflix.
"
21,4,Kenny,"Zuckerberg is the key. He's the only person who can shut down Facebook.
"
21,4,Kyle,"How are we gonna get him to do that?
"
21,4,Cartman,"We're gonna beat him at his own game.
"
21,4,Barkley,"We got the west entrance to town secure. How are you guys doing out east?
"
21,4,Foley,"Here he comes... 
"
21,4,Barkley,"Okay, Mr. Zuckerberg, that's gonna have to be it. Can't let you into town.
"
21,4,Mark,"So, you think you can block me.
"
21,4,Barkley,"Look, people don't want you here, okay? This is a quiet little town and-
"
21,4,Mark,"Ha ha ha! You cannot block me!
"
21,4,Barkley,"But there's plenty of other places you could go, sir. Can you please just-  Don't, don't do that, please.
"
21,4,Mark," My brain, my brain. 
"
21,4,Barkley,"He walked though.
"
21,4,Mark," Oh my car, my car.  Oh my God it's Mark Zuckerberg.  Oh my God how'd he do that? 
"
21,4,Jimmy,"What's the matter? Too f-fast for ya?
"
21,4,Mark,"Ha ha ha, you saw me walk right through the police barricade and yet you think you can block me, riiight? Go ahead and try. 
"
21,4,Tolkien," Now, Zuckerberg! Let me see you block my shtoile!
"
21,4,Mark,"Ha ha ha ha ha! 
"
21,4,Kyle," Bwa! Dadadadadadadada bam! 
"
21,4,Mark,"Oh...  Hagh. Ow. I have never witness this shtoile before.
"
21,4,Thomas,"Hey look! The freaky costume kids are getting Zuckerberg! Get him, kids!
"
21,4,Randy,"Poop in his mouth!
"
21,4,Mark," Rwaaaar!
"
21,4,Coon Friends," Aaaah!
"
21,4,Mark,"Ha ha ha, you tried to match my shtoile and failed!
"
21,4,Cartman," Oho, it is over! My friends are all beaten! Why?! They were just children!  This one, simply protesting for black lives!  And this child tryin' to speak out for handicapped people!
"
21,4,Jimmy,"Wha- Why, Mark Zuckerberg??
"
21,4,Cartman,"And my friend Kyle, guilty of nothing but standing up for the rights of Jews!
"
21,4,Mark,"What what what what are you talking about?
"
21,4,Cartman," Ever heard of Facebook Live?  We are just kids trying to have our voices heard for black, handicapped, and Jewish rights, cut down in our prime by Mark Zuckerberg.
"
21,4,Mark,"But, but hold on, that, that's not true.
"
21,4,Cartman," Facebook says it's true.
"
21,4,Mark,"Noooooooo! 
"
21,4,Workers,"Huh? Hey. What? Huh?
"
21,4,Butters,"What's goin' on? Hey everyone, keep working!
"
21,4,Worker 1,"We can't.
"
21,4,Worker 2,"Something's wrong with Facebook.
"
21,4,Adam,"It's gone. Like, somebody shut it down.
"
21,4,Butters,"What are you talking about? 
"
21,4,Cartman,"It's over, Chaos!  We forced your little toady to shut down his own disorder device!
"
21,4,Butters,"Curse you, Coon and Friends! This isn't over!
"
21,4,Stan,"Oh yes it is. 
"
21,4,Stephen,"Butters! You're the one who started all this?!
"
21,4,Butters,"Uh oh.
"
21,4,Stephen,"You think you're just so smart, don't you?! Make me look like a fool, will you?! We'll just see about this!
"
21,4,Butters,"Wah. No sir, I, ah. No sir, I just ah.
"
21,4,Stephen,"Not so funny now, is it?! Go on! Tell Mr. Putin what you told me!
"
21,4,Butters,"Well I was just, uh, well, I just said how I just used Facebook like Russia did. And I really didn't break any rules.
"
21,4,Stephen,"Didn't break any rules?! Good job teaching our children that's all that matters! Just because there's a way to cause chaos in a town, or disrupt an entire country, doesn't mean you go and do it, does it?! If Mark Zuckerberg points a loaded cannon at someone's face,  are you innocent for just lighting the fuse?! Answer me!
"
21,4,Putin,"Nyet, ser. 
"
21,4,Stephen,"No! You don't go around making things up about people either! Unless it's about Mark Zuckerberg, because he deserves it!  I hope you're both very satisfied with the damage you've caused, because you're both GROUNDED! 
"
21,4,Cartman,"Coon friends, we have done it. Facebook is gone, and Netflix approved our TV show. All we have to do now is agree on the final draft of the franchise plan.  You can see that the Super Craig movie now precedes the Coon vs. Super Craig movie, followed by Mysterion's video game. And then we-
"
21,4,Kenny,"How come I have to have the video game? I want a movie too!
"
21,4,Cartman,"You have a movie, Mysterion. You're in the third Coon and Friends United movie , after your video game.
"
21,4,Craig,"Yeah, but he's saying he doesn't ever get his own movie.
"
21,4,Jimmy,"Do I get my own movie?
"
21,4,Cartman,"Not everyone gets their own movie!
"
21,4,Tweek,"This franchise plan sucks!
"
21,4,Clyde,"Oh Jesus, here we go again.
"
21,4,Stan,"No, Wonder Tweek is right. It was better when we started the movies off with the Tupperware prequel.
"
21,4,Kyle,"Dude you can't do a prequel first.
"
21,4,Stan,"Why not?
"
21,4,Kyle,"'Cause then it's not a prequel, it's just... first. And besides, Tupperware isn't our strongest character.
"
21,4,Tolkien,"Fuck you, it's better than the Human Kite!
"
21,4,Kenny,"He just likes this plan because he gets two movies in Phase 1.
"
21,4,Cartman,"Guys! We have to just go with this plan! We don't even have one movie yet!
"
21,4,Stan,"You go with the plan! Maybe we'll just... go and do our own franchise!
"
21,4,Kenny,"Yeah!
"
21,4,Tweek,"Yeah!
"
21,4,Cartman,"Oh! You want civil war! Is that what you want?!
"
21,4,Stan,"Yeah dude, civil war. Fuck you! 
"
21,4,Cartman,"Oh fu- oh fuck you! Get out of my house!
"
21,4,Kenny,"We'll make WAY more money on OUR franchise! 
"
21,4,Cartman,"Go ahead! I bet you don't even get halfway through Phase 1 on your franchise, DC Comics! 
"
21,4,Craig,"I thought Civil War wasn't supposed to happen until Phase 3.
"
21,4,Cartman,"Shut up, Super Craig.


"
21,5,Marcus' Dad,"Okay, okay, can everyone hear me?  Hello?  Thanks, everyone, for helping us celebrate Marcus' birthday.  As a special birthday surprise for you, Marcus, we got you your favorite entertainer. Everyone, please welcome Chuck E. Cheese. 
"
21,5,Chuck E. Cheese,"Hey.  Check.
"
21,5,Marcus," Yes. Yehehehehes.
"
21,5,Chuck E. Cheese," I ah thanks... for'm celeb... Marcus's birthday.
"
21,5,Marcus' Mom,"What's wrong with him?
"
21,5,Marcus' Dad,"Can't you tell? He's high on painkillers!
"
21,5,Chuck," Hold on.  Shit. Okay, let's.... do this...  Never meant to cause you any so- 
"
21,5,Marcus' Dad,"All right, kids, uh, why don't we head back to the party and cut the cake?
"
21,5,Marcus,"I don't want cake! Who's gonna eat cake at a time like this?! 
"
21,5,Officer Stevens,"Another drug overdose?
"
21,5,Johnson," Most likely. Percolate and Oxycontin found wrapped in his cheesecloth.
"
21,5,Officer Stevens,"Prescription drugs, but with no prescription.
"
21,5,Johnson,"You guys know where all these illegal meds are coming from?
"
21,5,Officer Stevens,"Most likely from the prisons. Whenever there's a drug epidemic you can usually trace it back to people who've been... thrown away by society and forgotten about.
"
21,5,Vicky," Can I help you?
"
21,5,Stan,"Yeah, I'm here to visit my grandpa?
"
21,5,Vicky," Oh, how nice of you. All right, arms in the air.  What's the present?
"
21,5,Stan,"It's just some Hummels.
"
21,5,Vicky,"More Hummels? Why are senior citizens so infatuated with these little German statues? All right, go on, you got ten minutes. 
"
21,5,Stan,"Grandpa?
"
21,5,Marvin," Billy!  Finally you're here to visit. Did you bring Grandpa a present?
"
21,5,Stan," Yeah, I got what you wanted. 
"
21,5,Marvin,"Awww, Merry Wanderer  and Happy Traveler?  These Hummels suck!
"
21,5,Stan,"That's what the guy gave me.
"
21,5,Marvin,"It's okay, Billy. I'm just gonna need you to deliver another one of Ms. McGullicutty's crochet pillows.
"
21,5,Stan,"Aw, come on, Grandpa. Isn't it enough I come to visit?
"
21,5,Marvin,"You don't understand how it works in here. Ms. McGullicutty is top bitch. You do what she says, or you pay the price.
"
21,5,Elderly Man 1,"Oh, please, uh I don't want no trouble.  I'm sorry. I'll get better Hummels.
"
21,5,Kyle,"Dude, Stan. Come on, dude, we're gonna go set off fireworks at Kenny's house.
"
21,5,Stan,"I will. I just gotta do this for my grandpa first.
"
21,5,Cartman,"Again? Dude, how many crappy crochet pillows do you have to give out for him?
"
21,5,Stan,"I don't know. It's what he wants. I feel bad for him, all right? I think he's miserable.
"
21,5,Cartman,"He's old. He's supposed to be miserable.
"
21,5,Stan,"Look, I just gotta make this exchange for him and then we can go. Oh, oh, I think this is her now. 
"
21,5,Swiper,"Are you Stan Marsh? It's me, Swiper.
"
21,5,Stan,"Cool. Do you have the Hummel?
"
21,5,Swiper," This is it. Ride Into Christmas, Limited Edition. Now give me the pillow. I have to get to a birthday party.
"
21,5,Stan,"'Kay, fine. 
"
21,5,Swiper,"All right, peace. 
"
21,5,Kyle,"Dude, that's really weird.
"
21,5,Stan,"Old people love Hummels, dude.
"
21,5,Marcus,"Students, faculty, and staff, today we are facing an epidemic of catastrophic proportions. I know I am not alone in mourning the loss of one of our greatest entertainers,  Chuck E. Cheese. Had we known the personal hell he was going through, perhaps we could've helped. But toooo many were more than eager to supply Chuck E. with the opioids that caused his untimely death. Chuck E. was not the first entertainer to die from this epidemic. Let us not forget Dinkie Dook the Clown , dead of a Roxanol overdose at Tommy Schneider's bar mitzvah last March. Shimmer and Shine , who both collapsed from massive amounts of oxycodone at Nelly Anderson's birthday party. Spider-man, cut down in prime by Demerol, and just recently, Swiper the Fox. dead of multiple opioids found in his crochet pillow. How many more entertainers must we lose before we take action?! It is time to declare war on opioids in our society! 
"
21,5,Cartman,"Dude, what the fuck, Stan?!
"
21,5,Stan,"I don't know, all right?!
"
21,5,Kyle,"You didn't know you were slinging drugs for your grandpa?
"
21,5,Stan,"It didn't occur to me as a possibility.
"
21,5,Cartman,"Dude, did you hear everyone in school?! They're coming after you! You killed Swiper the Fox, and we were standing there with you! You gotta tell people we had no idea what was going on!
"
21,5,Stan,"I had no idea what was going on!
"
21,5,Butters," Hey fellas!  Boy, that Marcus kid is on the warpath, huh? Well, he's really motivated. I mean, screw that kid, but I guess it's good somebody's finally doing something about these goddamn drug dealers.  Well, see ya, fellas. 
"
21,5,Cartman,"Our only way out is to go to the police right now and turn Stan's grandpa in!
"
21,5,Stan,"No, we don't have to do that! Let me talk to him. I can put a stop to this.
"
21,5,Stan," Grandpa, what the hell have you gotten me into?!
"
21,5,Marvin," Shhh, quiet. They'll hear you!
"
21,5,Stan,"There were drugs in the crochet pillow, weren't there?! Do you know people are dying?!
"
21,5,Marvin,"What do you want me to do, Billy? You see Ms. McGullicutty over there?  Whoever has the best Hummel collection is top bitch in this place, and she's got the best. She's ruthless, and she has those old lady farts. You know old lady farts, right? Where they're so loose they don't even acknowledge they happened?
"
21,5,Ms. McGullicutty,"Oh, hello Mr. Marsh. 
"
21,5,Marvin,"Oh, Ms. McGullicutty. How are you feeling today?
"
21,5,Ms. McGullicutty,"I'm doing very well.  Have they given you Percocet for that knee of yours? 
"
21,5,Marvin,"Oh, yeah, here, I I just got it, huh. Here you go. 
"
21,5,Ms. McGullicutty,"Oh, you'd almost think you were trying to keep them from me. 
"
21,5,Stan,"Oh, uh, ma'am? My grandpa actually really needs those drugs. He's in a lot of pain.
"
21,5,Ms. McGullicutty,"Ohhh, and who's this little rascal? 
"
21,5,Marvin,"That's my grandson, uh he he's worthless.
"
21,5,Ms. McGullicutty,"How sweet.  Hmmm, coming to visit your old poppa in the joint, huh? You love your poppa, don't you?  You'd hate to see him suffer even more he already is.  You watch your ass, Marsh, or I'll have you sent to the quiet room. 
"
21,5,Stan,"What, what is she talking about? What's the quiet room?
"
21,5,Marvin,"I told you, she has all the pull in here. You go against what she says, you end up in solitaire.
"
21,5,Mr. Standish,"No! No, please, uh I didn't do anything!
"
21,5,Tony,"It's all right, Mr. Standish, you just need a little quiet time.
"
21,5,Mr. Standish,"Uh, I don't even know how to play solitaire. Please! 
"
21,5,Marcus,"I understand that today they are performing Chuck E. Cheese's autopsy?
"
21,5,Receptionist,"Oh, the kids' party performer. Yeah.
"
21,5,Marcus,"As a concerned member of the public, I wish to be present.
"
21,5,Receptionist,"Uh, sorry, children aren't really allowed in autopsies.
"
21,5,Marcus,"Then I shall wait here to learn the coroner's findings.
"
21,5,Coroner,"Toxicology reports show subject had massive amounts of opioids in system at time of death. Now proceeding. 
"
21,5,Coroner,"Have these put in the garbage.
"
21,5,Marcus,"What did you find, coroner?
"
21,5,Coroner,"Who is this?
"
21,5,Marcus,"There is an epidemic in our community, sir. Some of us actually care to confront the problem! Now, dammit, what did you find?
"
21,5,Coroner,"Nothing out of the ordinary. The subject died of a simple overdose. We found nothing else except for two Hummmels in the subject's rectal cavity.
"
21,5,Marcus,"Hummels? In his rectal cavity, you say? And you do not find this out of the ordinary?
"
21,5,Coroner,"Not at all. We found Hummels in nearly all the birthday entertainers' anal cavities. It's very common in our overdose victims.
"
21,5,Marcus,"Mmmm, a bit too common, don't you think?
"
21,5,Stan,"Guys, why does Grandpa have to be in a nursing home? Can't he live with us again?
"
21,5,Randy,"Stan, Grandpas has a lot of needs that we can't provide him here. He needs professional supervision.
"
21,5,Stan,"Is that really it? Because I, I just feel like we kind of threw Grandpa away and forgot about him.
"
21,5,Randy,"Oh really? Do you have any idea how much money we pay to have Grandpa in that place? Your grandpa is stylin'! Can you imagine being able to just sit around all day and not have to do anything but eat and watch TV?
"
21,5,Stan,"Yeah. I'd probably go crazy and wanna kill myself.
"
21,5,Randy,"Jesus, Stan! It's not like he's in jail!
"
21,5,Stan,"Yeah, it's kind of like jail. You should go visit him.
"
21,5,Randy,"I can't! I'm too busy busting my ass to pay the bills for that place, and to pay for your guitar lessons!
"
21,5,Stan,"I don't have guitar lessons.
"
21,5,Randy,"I don't want to go there. It's depressing. Aw you tricked me.
"
21,5,Stan," Hello?
"
21,5,Kyle," Dude! Did you give Butters a crochet pillow to drop off?!
"
21,5,Stan," Dude, I don't have a choice. I have to get the Hummels for my grandpa.
"
21,5,Kyle,"Well, you need to get Hummels without making Butters a drug dealer!
"
21,5,Butters,"Drug dealer??
"
21,5,Stan,"All right, all right! I think I know another way.
"
21,5,Delivery man,"Hey, we have this week's delivery of medications.
"
21,5,Vicky,"Bring them in. 
"
21,5,Stan,"Ah!
"
21,5,Marcus,"Hello, Mr. Marsh.
"
21,5,Stan,"Uh hey, hey Marcus.
"
21,5,Marcus,"I understand you've become quite the Hummel collector lately. What's the... fascination with Hummels?
"
21,5,Stan,"Nothing. I-look, I, I just really like Hummels, okay? I'm just, I'm really into Hummels.
"
21,5,Marcus,"Ah! I see. So then you should be able to tell me what this Hummel is called!
"
21,5,Stan,"That, that's uh...
"
21,5,Marcus,"Come on! If you're a Hummel expert, then you should know its name!
"
21,5,Stan,"That, it's, it's ""Whistling In The Rain.""
"
21,5,Marcus,"Wrong! It's called ""Stormy Weather!"" Do you know where it was found?
"
21,5,Stan,"No.
"
21,5,Marcus,"It was found deep in the anus of one Chuck E. Cheese, the renowned entertainer beloved by millions! If you know something about the epidemic that is killing artists, you'd better cough it up!
"
21,5,Stan,"Marcus, trust me. You don't wanna get involved.
"
21,5,Marcus,"I became involved when Chuck E. Cheese collapsed like a rag doll before my very eyes! If you had any involvement, I will bring you down!
"
21,5,Randy,"Well, it's really great seeing you, Dad. Guess we oughtta hit the road soon.
"
21,5,Marvin,"You finally come to visit and leave after 10 minutes?
"
21,5,Randy,"Aw Jesus, now we know where Stan gets his guilt trips from!
"
21,5,Mrs. McGullicutty," Mmmm , it seems somebody's been a little naughty lately. 
"
21,5,Marvin," Oh, Ms. McGullicutty, heh heh. How are you?
"
21,5,Mrs. McGullicutty," Hrrmm. My, what a lovely Hummel collection you're starting to amass.  Almost smells ... brand new, doesn't it?  Like it was purchased right from the factory.  Ooooo! And who are these lovely people?  Family that came to visit, no doubt? 
"
21,5,Randy," Yes. Yeah, we love coming here.
"
21,5,Mrs. McGullicutty,"Ah, family. I remember when I was a little girl.  My brother used to play such tricks on me.  Tried to fool me. Tried to get out from his responsibilities. 
"
21,5,Marvin,"I'm giving you Hummels. What's it matter where they came from? 
"
21,5,Mrs. McGullicutty," Nooo,  it doesn't matter to me. But it matters to them.  The big guys. You see, what they want is more people who are addicted to crochet pillows.  Got it?  Nice to meet you fine folks. 
"
21,5,Randy,"Wugh.  We're never visiting here again.
"
21,5,Cartman,"Ohooo, you're dead Butters.
"
21,5,Butters,"Haw Jeez.
"
21,5,Stan," Guys! Guys, I need your help.
"
21,5,Cartman,"If it has to do with your heroin operation, count us out.
"
21,5,Stan,"I just talked to my grandpa. There's more at work here than just old people pushing pills.
"
21,5,Kyle,"Stan, we told you we don't wanna be involved.
"
21,5,Stan," The head bitch of the nursing home is gonna take my grandpa down. Maybe my whole family.
"
21,5,Butters," Get out of the way, dude!
"
21,5,Stan,"But I know what to do! Whoever has the best Hummels controls the nursing home. We've gotta steal this lady's Hummel collection and give it to my grandpa!
"
21,5,Cartman," Dude, Stan, even if we wanted to help you, which we don't, there's no way we can sneak into an old folks home, distract all the old people, and take an old lady's Hummels!  Oh wait, there totally is a way we could do that.
"
21,5,Stan," Yeah? What ih, what is it, Cartman.
"
21,5,Kyle,"Dude, we're not getting involved!
"
21,5,Stan,"Cartman, if you have an idea, please tell me. I need you.
"
21,5,Cartman,"I know how to distract old people.
"
21,5,Kyle,"Haww shit!
"
21,5,Marcus,"Yes?
"
21,5,Annie,"We're at Mimi Thompson's party. Peppa Pig just collapsed on stage. 
"
21,5,Marcus,"Oh my God! Don't let anyone near Peppa Pig until I arrive!  Move aside! Let me through!  Aw Peppa. Peppa, can you hear me?  My name is Marcus Preston. Can you understand me? Where did you get the drugs, Peppa? Was it from Stan Marsh?
"
21,5,Peppa," Yo man, whatchoo talkin' about? Get me a fuckin' ambulance!
"
21,5,Marcus," Shh, Peppa. Focus. Soon you'll be in heaven jumping in all the puddles you can imagine. But first, you must tell me, where do the Hummels go, Peppa?
"
21,5,Ambulance lady,"All right, let us through. Get away, kids.
"
21,5,Marcus,"Peppa, now! Why Hummels?! You've got to squeal!
"
21,5,Peppa,"Old people. Old people... love... Hummels. 
"
21,5,Marcus,"It's okay, she's with Chuck E. Cheese now.
"
21,5,Vicky,"Can I help you?
"
21,5,Cartman,"Oh yes, hello. We are adorable children here to entertain old people.
"
21,5,Vicky,"Didn't think we had anyone scheduled tonight. Are you with the Protestant youth group?
"
21,5,Cartman,"Yes that's right, we are young prostitutes here to volunteer however we can.
"
21,5,Vicky,"Fine. Round them up, we got another kids choir!
"
21,5,Toby,"Come on, let's go. Children's choir in the commons.
"
21,5,Residents," Aw dammit. Shit.
"
21,5,Toby,"Darlin' children are gonna sing for you! Move your asses!
"
21,5,Elderly Man 2,"Aw, not again.
"
21,5,Cartman,"All right, seniors. How are we feeling tonight? Our youth group has come to lift your spirits with some songs to take you down memory lane. We hope you can enjoy some nice old-people music. 
"
21,5,Cartman,"
I'm... insane in the membrane.


"
21,5,The Boys,"
Insane in the membrane.


"
21,5,Butters,"
Insane in the brain


"
21,5,The Boys,"
Crazy insane, got no brain.


"
21,5,Cartman,"
In the membrane.


"
21,5,Cartman,"
Myyyy milkshake brings all the boys


"
21,5,The Boys,"
to the yard, and they're like  it's better than yours.


"
21,5,Cartman,"
Damn right!


"
21,5,The Boys,"
 it's better than yours.


"
21,5,Cartman,"
My hot milkshake.

 And now here's our own take on that oldie, but goodie by Nirvana.
"
21,5,The Boys,"
In the cool, cool winter.


"
21,5,Cartman,"
Rape me.


"
21,5,The Boys,"
In the hot hot summertime.
Rape me, my friend.


"
21,5,Elderly Man 3,"You suck!
"
21,5,Cartman,"Hey hey! We are adorable children trying to bring sunshine into your lives!
"
21,5,Elderly Man 3," Fuck you!

21,5,Cartman,"Fuck you!  
If you


"
21,5,The Boys,"
Want to call me baby


"
21,5,Cartman,"
Just go ahead now-


"
21,5,Marcus,"Hello, Mr. Marsh!
"
21,5,Stan,"Marcus.
"
21,5,Marcus," I told you I'd bring you down. 
"
21,5,Stan,"Marcus, it's not what you think. I'm trying to make things better here. 
"
21,5,Marcus,"Oh, I bet you are! You, your grandpa, ALL the people here, are going to jail! I'm calling the police!
"
21,5,Stan,"You can put an end to this place, but you won't be stopping the problem. These people are victims too, Marcus. Victims of a way bigger game being played by way bigger people!
"
21,5,Marcus," Oh, you're a fine one for speeches! When it comes to saving your own ass!
"
21,5,Stan,"It's not for me, Marcus. Look, I know you loved Chuck E. Cheese.  I know you'd do anything to bring down the people who took him from you.  That's why you have to go further, Marcus. Take it to the people who profited from Chuck E.'s addiction.
"
21,5,Marcus," He was just a mouse... who wanted to make people happy. 
"
21,5,Stan,"I know. I know.
"
21,5,The Boys,"
No time to search the world around
When I come around. When I come around.


"
21,5,Cartman,"
I come around.

 
"
21,5,Butters,"Hey, where are ya'll goin'?
"
21,5,Mrs. McGullicutty,"Back to our rooms. You kids are absolutely awful. 
"
21,5,Mrs. McGullicutty," What the?  Someone is in my room! 
"
21,5,Mrs. McGullicutty,"Whaaaat?! 
"
21,5,Marvin,"Billy. What are you doin' here?
"
21,5,Stan," Surprise, Grandpa.  I got what you needed.
"
21,5,Marvin,"Heh.  Billy, Mrs. McGullicutty's Hummel collection. You got it for me.
"
21,5,Stan,"Yeah, Grandpa. Now you can put a stop to all this, right?
"
21,5,Marvin,"Yeah. I just might be able to.
"
21,5,Stan,"What are you doing, Grandpa?
"
21,5,Marvin,"I told you, Billy. These Hummels hold a special power with old people.
"
21,5,Mrs. McGullicutty," You! 
"
21,5,Marvin," Go on, get out of here.
"
21,5,Mrs. McGullicutty,"You really thought stealing my Hummels would make you the head bitch in this place?! 
"
21,5,Marvin,"Yeah. I think it will. 
"
21,5,Mrs. McGullicutty,"Aaah! 
"
21,5,Marvin," Now you know how we do shit in the nursing home.
"
21,5,Cartman,"...That's pretty sweet.
"
21,5,Mrs. McGullicutty,"You get your paws off of me, young man! 
"
21,5,Tony,"There there, Ms. McGullicutty. Everything's gonna be all right. 
"
21,5,Mrs. McGullicutty,"No!  Not solitaire!  I won't play it! You can't make me! 
"
21,5,Stan,"Congratulations on becoming head bitch, Grandpa.
"
21,5,Marvin,"Thank you, Billy. Now if we could only take down the real douchebags who profit from all this.
"
21,5,Stan,"Ahhh, don't worry. I have a feeling that's about to happen.
"
21,5,Marcus,"Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Marcus Preston. I have... some questions.
"
21,6,Stuart,"What time are the other guys gettin' there?
"
21,6,Roger,"Everyone just said sundown, which should be soon.

"
21,6,Sharon,"Oh no, you're not doing this again.
"
21,6,Randy,"What do you mean? Of course I am.
"
21,6,Sharon,"Stan wanted us to take him to the pumpkin patch.
"
21,6,Randy,"Sharon, you know the week leading up to Halloween is always my Witch Party Week with the guys.
"
21,6,Sharon,"Yeah, and you guys get wasted.

"
21,6,Chip,"I'll kill you all! Kill you all!
"
21,6,Chip," You'll all be dead by Halloween! 
"
21,6,Ticket-taker,"Get out! Everyone out!

21,6,Ticket-taker,"There's a witch! 
"
21,6,Heidi,"Come on, Eric!
"
21,6,Cartman,"No! I missed it! I missed it all! 
"
21,6,Randy,"Oh. Hey, didn't see you there.
"
21,6,Sharon,"Did you hear anything about what happened last night?
"
21,6,Randy,"Uuuhhh, nnno, what happened?
"
21,6,Sharon,"Your buddy, Chip Duncan?  Apparently, he flew around on a broom, blew things up, and kidnapped some children?
"
21,6,Randy,"Are you serious?!
"
21,6,Sharon,"You heard nothing about this?! He flew away vowing we'd all be dead by Halloween!
"
21,6,Randy," God, I knew that guy was a fuckin' chode!
"
21,6,Sharon,"Randy, what did you guys do at that party?
"
21,6,Randy," Nothin'. We were just hangin' out and talkin' and stuff, and then Chip got all weird.
"
21,6,Sharon,"People were hurt!
"
21,6,Randy,"Yeah, I agree! It's awful! We're not like Chip, okay?! He's a bad witch!
"
21,6,Kyle,"Did any of you guys actually see the witch?
"
21,6,Jimmy,"Yeah, it was terrifying. She had a broom and a cackle and everything.
"
21,6,Tolkien,"What are we gonna do, guys?
"
21,6,Butters,"Our parents are never gonna let us trick or treat with a flying witch around! 
"
21,6,Kyle,"They say she blew up the pumpkin patch. Did any of you guys see that?
"
21,6,Stan,"No, I missed the whole thing. I always try to get to the pumpkin patch really early.
"
21,6,Butters,"Yeah, I got there really early too. You get the best pumpkins that way. Anyways, I guess the witch destroyed the whole thing. 
"
21,6,Stan,"We've got to take matters into our own hands. None of us is safe.
"
21,6,Butters,"Yeah, but what are we gonna do?
"
21,6,Kyle,"No, we've got to just hope the police will handle it.
"
21,6,Stan,"Yeah, right. Like they'll handle anything. 
"
21,6,Tolkien,"Stan's right. This might fall on us. 
"
21,6,Butters,"Yeah, we've got to save Halloween. Don't you think so, Eric?
"
21,6,Cartman," What?
"
21,6,Butters,"We've got to do something to get rid of her!
"
21,6,Cartman,"Yes. You're right, guys. It's my only way out.
"
21,6,Randy,"All right, see you, Sharon. Have a good night.
"
21,6,Sharon," Where do you think you're going?
"
21,6,Randy,"What do you mean? It's Day 2 of Witch Week with the guys.
"
21,6,Sharon," You can't possibly be considering doing this again!
"
21,6,Randy,"Why not?
"
21,6,Sharon,"Randy, a real witch is flying around in the skies snatching children! I don't think this is the best time for you to be wearing a witch costume and partying!
"
21,6,Randy,"Wugh! Gau! Just because of one bad witch we're supposed to stop a tradition that goes back twenty-someodd years?! Jesus! 
"
21,6,Gerald,"Hey Randy.
"
21,6,Randy,"Sup guys?
"
21,6,Ryan,"You know, just getting a bunch of shit for being witches.
"
21,6,Randy,"I know, right? It's like, there's one awful witch who wants to kill everybody, so now they're coming after all of us. This is like a witch... thingy.
"
21,6,Stuart,"It's like a witch pursuit thingy.
"
21,6,Randy,"A witch uhhh-
"
21,6,Gerald,"It's a witch chase and shoot 'em up.
"
21,6,Randy,"Yeah, that's what it is!
"
21,6,Ryan,"Hey, what the hell is this?
"
21,6,Randy," ""Park closed until further notice"". That's bullshit!
"
21,6,Stuart,"Oh my God.
"
21,6,Randy,"They can't do this! The whole town really is on a witch pursuit thing!
"
21,6,Kyle,"Check this out, you guys. It says that to destroy a witch you need bent pits, nine in all, each bent into an L shape.
"
21,6,Stan,"What are bent pits? 
"
21,6,Cartman,"Hey guys, I think I got it figured out.
"
21,6,Stan,"You do?
"
21,6,Butters,"I knew Eric would come up with a plan! 
"
21,6,Cartman,"Okay, first of all, we need a scary place to lure her into. What is the creepiest place in town? Ross Dress for Less, that's right. Stan and Kyle will wait inside the Ross Dress for Less, and I will bring Heidi there. Once inside, Kenny and Butters will set off a series of explosions that will-
"
21,6,Stan,"Wait wait wait wait. What the fuck are you talking about?
"
21,6,Cartman,"This is how we're going to get rid of Heidi.
"
21,6,Kyle,"Nobody's talking about getting rid of Heidi!
"
21,6,Cartman,"You guys said you would help me get rid of her!
"
21,6,Kyle,"OF THE WITCH!
"
21,6,Cartman,"Who cares about a witch?! My life is a living hell, you guys!
"
21,6,Kyle,"Then break up with her! You clearly can't stand her! LET THE POOR GIRL GO!
"
21,6,Cartman,"I've tried! It's impossible!
"
21,6,Kyle,"Heidi is a nice girl! How could you be so awful to her?!
"
21,6,Cartman,"You don't understand! She has no time-management skills whatsoever! You don't know 'cause you've never had a girlfriend, Kyle!  Fine. Just leave me to suffer. Next time you want me to kill someone for you, just forget about it! 
"
21,6,Mayor McDaniels,"Students and parents, I know that you are all concerned about the witch who is preying upon our town, and I wanna speak to you all about how to try and protect yourselves. But first, some gentlemen have asked to speak on what they perceive to be a  ""witch pursuit thing"". 
"
21,6,Richard,"Oh wait, I'm supposed to be-
"
21,6,Randy,"Yeah, sure, no.  You go over there.
"
21,6,Stuart,"Right. Right right right. 
"
21,6,The men,"
We're all on the same side, you and I.
Let's all stick togetha, let's try.
When things are going bad and there's people you need to confront.
Just be sure it doesn't turn into a witch pursuit thing.


"
21,6,Stephen," Hey guys, there's good witches and there's bad witches, and we stand with you in saying this particular witch needs to be brought down. But that doesn't men we should all be closing parks and stopping all witch activity because 
"
21,6,The men,"
Let's not turn this into a witch pursuit thing.


"
21,6,Kyle," Dad, get out of here! We're trying to deal with an actual witch! Nobody's coming after you!
"
21,6,Gerald,"Yes they are, boys! And next they'll be coming after you! 'Cause you're all little sons a witches!
"
21,6,Ryan,"Right. You don't have to worry about us, going around snatching children. Only the other witch does that. 
"
21,6,Cartman,"Hey, babe.
"
21,6,Heidi,"Oh. Hey Eric.
"
21,6,Cartman,"Listen uh, there's a big fun costume party tonight and I was thinking you and me should go. What do you say?
"
21,6,Heidi,"A costume party? With everything that's going on?
"
21,6,Cartman,"Yeah, I just think, you know, we need to let off some steam and have a little Halloween fun, you know? I already have our costumes picked out.
"
21,6,Heidi,"Well... I guess.
"
21,6,Cartman,"Cool. I'll pick you up at 5.
"
21,6,Heidi,"Well, maybe make it 4:30 if you're bringing the costumes.  I might need a little extra time getting ready.
"
21,6,Cartman," Ohohoh, I'm counting on it. 
"
21,6,Stephen,"Randy, can I talk to you?
"
21,6,Randy,"Sure, Stephen.
"
21,6,Stephen,"I've been doing a lot of thinking, Randy. About the past. About what we've done. I think it's time we come clean and tell everyone about the crack. And the spells against our wives.
"
21,6,Randy," Okay, look. You're freaked out, it's understandable.
"
21,6,Stephen,"I have to admit what I've done wrong, Randy! I feel like everything's crashing down and I want Linda to hear it from me first.
"
21,6,Randy,"Okay, we smoked a little crack. We put harmless spells on our wives. We were just messing around, it was harmless fun.
"
21,6,Stephen,"Was it? Or did we close our eyes to what Chip Duncan was becoming?
"
21,6,Randy,"Stephen, you can't turn on your own kind. That's what these witch pursuit thingies do, okay? They make everyone go crazy.
"
21,6,Stephen,"I'm sorry, Randy. I have to clear my conscience.
"
21,6,Randy," All right, Stephen. At least give us till tomorrow morning to talk to our wives and prepare them, all right? Can you just give us till morning?
"
21,6,Stephen,"Yeah, sure.  I'm sorry.
"
21,6,Randy,"It's okay. It's okay.  Hey, it's Randy. We’ve got until tomorrow morning to sacrifice Stephen to the Devil. I'll explain later, just get everyone together. And, maybe bring just a little bit of crack.
"
21,6,Heidi,"Don't you think we should stay on the main roads, Eric? This seems like a bad place to be right now.
"
21,6,Cartman,"Don't worry, Heidi. This is the fastest way to the party.  I'm sure the witch won't even notice us.
"
21,6,Heidi,"Eric, come on, this is a bad idea. Let's turn around.
"
21,6,Cartman,"Well, Heidi, if we'd been on time, we wouldn't need to take a short cut. But I wanted to give you your space to get ready.
"
21,6,Heidi," Is that what this is about? You're still mad about the pumpkin patch, aren't you?
"
21,6,Cartman,"Why would I be mad? You wanted to make sure you looked right, and then you had to eat and use the bathroom 40 times. I can't blame you for missing the pumpkin patch.
"
21,6,Heidi,"I didn't use the bathroom 40 times!  What was that?  Eric! Did you hear that?!  Eric?! Eric! Oh my God! Eric, are you okay?!
"
21,6,Chip," Well, well. What have we here?
"
21,6,Cartman," Sweet. Come on, come on.
"
21,6,Stan,"Dude, is your dad home?
"
21,6,Kyle,"No, I, I don't know where he is.
"
21,6,Stan,"We can't find our dads either.
"
21,6,Butters,"Yeah, and it turns out our dads and the bad witch were all part of the same witch group.
"
21,6,Stan,"We asked our moms, and they said this has been going on for years. We've got to find them before something stupider happens.
"
21,6,Kyle,"How are we gonna do that?
"
21,6,Stan,"There's another guy. Someone else who was in the witches' club that hasn't been around for a while.
"
21,6,Kyle,"Who?
"
21,6,President's Aide," Mr. President, you have an urgent call from a Butters Stotch?
"
21,6,Garrison," Butters? What's he want?  This is the President.
"
21,6,Butters,"Oh, uh, eh hello Mr. President. How are you?
"
21,6,Stan," Butter him up, Butters.
"
21,6,Butters,"How uh, how is runnin' the country going?
"
21,6,Garrison,"Oh, it's fine. You know, just makin' the country great again.
"
21,6,Butters,"Did you get rid of all the immigrants like you said?
"
21,6,Garrison,"I got rid of like, six of 'em so far. You know, it's a little harder than I thought.
"
21,6,Butters,"Cool. Ah-and did you build that big wall you were gonna build?
"
21,6,Garrison,"Don't be a dick, Butters. Are you just callin' to shit on my Halloween?
"
21,6,Butters,"N-no, sir! I uh, well, the thing is, uh, didn't you used to do J and C Witch Week with our dads?
"
21,6,Garrison,"Yeah, it was my favorite time of year. Now I just have to celebrate it alone.
"
21,6,Butters,"Well, the thing is, Mr. President, one of the guys did a spell and took a bunch of children, and he's gonna eat 'em all.
"
21,6,Garrison,"Lemme guess: Chip Duncan. Oh, that guy was always such a douche.
"
21,6,Butters,"Mr. President, please, you've gotta help. Our dads can't do anything 'cause they're scared people are comin' after all wtiches.
"
21,6,Garrison,"Comin' after all witches? Oh, Jeez...
"
21,6,Sgt. Yates,"So you were there when the witch showed up and took your girlfriend.
"
21,6,Cartman,"Yes, it just came out of nowhere. I tried to save Heidi, but it was too late.
"
21,6,Sgt. Yates,"What was your girlfriend wearing?
"
21,6,Cartman,"She was dressed kind of like me, but had a simple Munich dirndl from Germany.
"
21,6,Rick,"And you didn't stop at all to think that what you were doing might attract a witch?
"
21,6,Cartman,"Excuse me?! Are you actually trying to blame the victim here?!
"
21,6,Rick,"No, I'm just saying that if there's a big fat witch around, maybe you shouldn't walk around in the woods dressed as Hansel and Gretel.
"
21,6,Cartman,"Ohhhhh!
"
21,6,Sgt. Yates,"Whoa, whoa, not cool, Rick. Not cool.
"
21,6,Cartman,"I will have your badge, sir!
"
21,6,Sgt. Yates," Sorry folks, sorry.
"
21,6,Cop 1,"Detective! Detective! Call just came in. The witch has been spotted at Ross Dress For Less.
"
21,6,Sgt. Yates,"Everyone to Ross Dress For Less, now!
"
21,6,Stephen,"Guys? I'm here. Guys? What's this all about?
"
21,6,Randy,"Hello, Stephen.
"
21,6,Stephen,"Oh, hey. What are we meeting here for?
"
21,6,Ryan,"It's too late, Stephen. We called the police. We know you took those children.
"
21,6,Stephen,"What? What uh, What are you doing?
"
21,6,Steve," Here he is, everybody! Stephen's a bad witch!
"
21,6,Stephen,"Nooo! 
"
21,6,Randy,"We're putting a stop to you, Stephen, because that's what good witches do!
"
21,6,Stephen,"Oh my God! I see what this is! This witch pursuit thing has you on a witch pursuit thing now!  I'm innocent. Please!
"
21,6,Sgt. Yates,"It's over, Stotch. What have you done with the children?
"
21,6,Stephen,"Noho, don't you see?! They're just doing their own witch pursuit thingy now! This is madness! 
"
21,6,Chip," Hey, what's up, bros?
"
21,6,Stephen,"""What's up, bros?"" Chip, do you see all the chaos you've caused?
"
21,6,Chip,"Yeah, so? I'm a witch.
"
21,6,Randy,"Ugh, you understand everyone associates us with you, right?
"
21,6,Chip,"Of course they do. You're all witches too, dudes!
"
21,6,Steve,"Not like you!
"
21,6,Stuart,"What'd you do with the children?
"
21,6,Chip,"They're all in here! See? 
"
21,6,Kids," Daddy, help! Mommy, help! Ahh!
"
21,6,Chip,"I'm going to use their souls to increase my power!
"
21,6,A townsman,"Look! Another witch is flying down now! 
"
21,6,Stan,"Butters, come on! We've gotta go!
"
21,6,Butters,"Okay! Where?
"
21,6,Stan,"I guess our witches were gonna sacrifice your witch, but then the bad witch showed up and now the witch we called just arrived. There's witches everywhere!
"
21,6,Butters,"Holy moly! 
"
21,6,Randy,"Look, Chip, if we had known you were gonna hurt people, we would have never even hung out.
"
21,6,Chip,"Oh, give me a break, Randy.
"
21,6,Randy,"No, seriously.
"
21,6,Chip,"Like if one of you guys had the power I have, you wouldn't use it.
"
21,6,Randy,"No we wouldn't!
"
21,6,Garrison,"Excuse me. 
"
21,6,Chip,"Oh, hey man!
"
21,6,Garrison,"You're ruining the party for everyone, Chip! I'm here to take you out!
"
21,6,Chip," You'll never stop me!  I grow more powerful every moment!
"
21,6,Garrison,"You wanna see real power?  All right, take the shot. 
"
21,6,Peter," I'm free! 
"
21,6,A girl,"Mommy! Daddy! 
"
21,6,Sgt. Yates,"Is that all of them?
"
21,6,Cop 2,"There's one more little girl. Come on out, little girl.
"
21,6,Heidi,"Okay. Just a second.
"
21,6,Cop 2,"Com- come on, little girl. Everyone's waitin' on ya.
"
21,6,Heidi,"Okay. Almost ready. Hang on.
"
21,6,Cartman," It's gonna be a while.
"
21,6,Gerald,"Well, we did it, guys.
"
21,6,Ryan,"Everyone will be stoked on us now.
"
21,6,Randy,"Hey! And there's still a few nights left of Jack and Crack Witch Week.
"
21,6,Garrison,"Everybody follow me! I've got tons of Jack, tons of crack, and a jet! 
"
21,6,The men,"Party's back on! We did it, guys!
"
21,6,Randy," Don't wait up, Sharon! I'm gonna party with El Presidente. 
"
21,6,Heidi,"All ready to trick or treat?
"
21,6,Cartman," Yeah, no. I've been ready for a couple hours now.
"
21,6,Heidi,"Cool. I just wanna put on some lip gloss. Do these stockings go with this outfit? I thought maybe I should use the red ones.  Is it cold out? You think I should put a hoodie on over this? Nah, covers up my costume too much, don't you think?  Okay, all ready.  Oh wait, hang on.  I can't decide if I should wear leggings or not. Is it gonna be cold? Should I just-
"
21,7,Heidi," Yes, Eric?
"
21,7,Cartman," Heidi! Heidi! Heidi! Heidi! Heidi! Heidi! Heidi!-
"
21,7,Heidi,"Eric, this isn't working.
"
21,7,Cartman,"Heid- Heidi, no, please! Heidi, Heidi, I would be nothing without you, okay? I'm sorry. Okay? Please!
"
21,7,Heidi,"You called me a whore and pushed me in front of a car.
"
21,7,Cartman,"Heidi, I was in a bad mood! I told you, that's what happens after I eat! My blood sugar spikes and I get all anxious, and then I cra-
"
21,7,Heidi,"Eric, you just can't keep being mean to me and blaming it on your blood sugar.
"
21,7,Cartman,"But ih, but it's true, Heidi! It's all my mom's fault. She feeds me all this crap, and my body doesn't know how to process it. Mom! Mom!
"
21,7,Liane,"Yes, hon?
"
21,7,Cartman,"You fucked up my life, Mom! Fuck you! How could you feed me like that, you bitch?! Get outta here!
"
21,7,Heidi,"Eric, if blood sugar is really the problem, then you need to change how you eat, right?
"
21,7,Cartman,"Right. Like, whattaya whattaya mean?
"
21,7,Heidi,"Eric, every time I've talked to you about maybe being a vegan with me, you just tell me vegans are pussies. But then you try and blame food and your mom for being-
"
21,7,Cartman,"It is the food, and it is my mom, Heidi! It is! I wanna be vegan with you! I need your help to show me how. Please, Heidi. I need you right now, more than ever. I wand to do this. Please!
"
21,7,Heidi,"You really mean it?
"
21,7,Cartman,"Yes, Heidi! That's how much I love you! I'm vegan from now on.
"
21,7,Heidi,"All right, Eric. We'll see how this goes, okay? See you tomorrow.
"
21,7,Cartman,"Okay. Okay, bye, honey. 
"
21,7,Cartman,"That dirty whore! Who does that bitch think she is?! Packing my lunch for me?! Fuck her, dude!
"
21,7,Jimmy,"Pissed off at your girlfriend again, huh Eric?
"
21,7,Cartman,"She's not a girlfriend! She's a controlling, manipulative whore!
"
21,7,Kyle,"That's enough, Cartman! I am so sick of hearing you call Heidi horrible things!
"
21,7,Cartman,"That's because you don't understand how much it sucks to be in a relationship!
"
21,7,Heidi," Hey babe.
"
21,7,Cartman,"Oh hey babe, what's going on?
"
21,7,Heidi,"What are you up to?
"
21,7,Cartman," Nothin', just tellin' the guys how awesome it is to be vegan.
"
21,7,Heidi," That's great. You wanna come eat with me? I can explain what I packed.
"
21,7,Cartman,"Yeah, sure. That sounds awesome. 
"
21,7,Kyle,"I don't get it. I just really don't get it. How is she still supporting him?!
"
21,7,Stan,"She loves him, I guess.
"
21,7,Kyle,"But he clearly sucks! She has to know he sucks. What the hell is going on?!
"
21,7,Butters,"Well, it's not our problem.
"
21,7,Kyle,"It is our problem. This is affecting us! Our whole school. There's got to be a reason she sticks by him.
"
21,7,Kyle," Oh Heidi? Heidi, you got a sec?
"
21,7,Heidi,"Oh. Hey Kyle.
"
21,7,Kyle,"Hey. Uh, listen, uh... I-I know you and Cartman have an anniversary coming up and, I was just wondering, you know, um. How do you think he's doing? Aaas a boyfriend.
"
21,7,Heidi,"Well, whattaya mean?
"
21,7,Kyle,"Well, you know, like, some of us are thinking that, uh, maybe he's not super-qualified to be with you?
"
21,7,Heidi,"Oh, God, not you too.
"
21,7,Kyle,"Just, like, what are the things about Cartman that you find remotely redeeming?
"
21,7,Heidi,"Look, don't you think I get it enough from my girlfriends? ""He sucks, Heidi. What's wrong with you? Why can't you admit he's a loser? How could anyone ever go with him?"" I was just following my heart. Isn't that what you're supposed to do?
"
21,7,Kyle,"You don't have to get defensive. I just-
"
21,7,Heidi," Who's being defensive?! He's great! We're doing great! I didn't make a bad decision! I don't need you to stand there and say ""I told you so!"" 
"
21,7,Kyle,"I didn't say ""I...  told you-""
"
21,7,Heidi," You know, you don't know what Eric's like when we're alone, okay? He's actually really good to me. 
"
21,7,Kyle,"Wooow.
"
21,7,Cartman,"Heidi!  Oh my God, you're not gonna believe this.
"
21,7,Heidi,"What?
"
21,7,Cartman,"You were so right  when you said there were vegan options for everything.  Remember how you told me about Beyond Meat?
"
21,7,Heidi,"Yeah, the vegan meat that's made with all vegetables and plants.
"
21,7,Cartman,"Well, I tried it and you were right. You can't even tell the difference between that and real meat.
"
21,7,Heidi,"Really? That's great, babe.
"
21,7,Cartman,"So now I've been trying all kinds of vegan foods. You gotta try this. It's called Beyond KFC.
"
21,7,Heidi,"Oh wow.
"
21,7,Cartman,"It's all plant based, soy protein, and just- y-you gotta taste it. Just try it.
"
21,7,Heidi," It tasted just like KFC.
"
21,7,Cartman,"I know, right?! Isn't that crazy?!  Like, like seriously, how can you even tell that this was vegan? Try the, try the Beyond Mashed Potatoes and Gravy too.  They say you can even drink the Beyond Gravy by itself as like a protein boost.  I don't know about you, but I could eat this every day.
"
21,7,Heidi,"Yeah, it's really good.
"
21,7,Cartman," Delicious.
"
21,7,Kyle,"Guys, listen: I think I know why Heidi won't admit Cartman's a horrible boyfriend.
"
21,7,Stan,"Dude, are you still on this?
"
21,7,Kyle,"Yeah! It's important.
"
21,7,Butters,"Maybe she's telling the truth, Kyle. Maybe Eric really does love and support her in ways that we don't see.
"
21,7,Cartman," You guys! You guys! Have you seen Heidi? 
"
21,7,Stan,"No.
"
21,7,Cartman,"Well uh, we've been trying some different foods lately and uh,  Heidi's put on some pounds, you guys.
"
21,7,Tolkien,"Heidi's getting fat?
"
21,7,Cartman,"Yeah, Tolkien. Don't start rippin' on me for havin' a fat girlfriend, alright? Just try and be cool about it. 
"
21,7,Heidi," Hey babe.
"
21,7,Cartman,"Oh, hey hey hey, Heidi. What's goin' on? 
"
21,7,Heidi,"I-ah, I'm not feeling the best again.  I might see if my mom can come pick me up.
"
21,7,Cartman,"Pick you up? That could be tough. 
"
21,7,Heidi,"I, I know, but I just feel bloated. I think there might have been something bad in that Beyond Arby's.
"
21,7,Cartman,"Yeah, well, cool, babe. Maybe you should uh, just waddle on down to the nurse's office. 
"
21,7,Heidi,"Can you come with?
"
21,7,Cartman,"Oh sure. 
"
21,7,Kyle,"We have to help that girl. Can't you see what's happening?
"
21,7,Stan,"Kyle, it's none of our business.
"
21,7,Kyle,"You're wrong. In a way... I think we're all going out with Cartman right now.
"
21,7,Garrison,"Uh huh. Yeah, I understand that, faggot. And you should understand how my balls are gonna taste when your country starts needing money. I don't give two shits about a treaty. You're a Polish midget.  Come in.  Uh huh. Hang, uh hang on. I'm gonna call you back. Yeah, go fuck yourself, retard. 
"
21,7,Mitch McConnell,"Mr. President, we have a problem. People are pretty upset.
"
21,7,Garrison,"Hoh, don't tell me people are still made about that n*gger thing.
"
21,7,Mike Pence,"It's pronounced Niger, Mr. President. And it's a country in Africa.
"
21,7,Garrison,"Oh, aren't we fancy. Okay, I don't want a bunch of  Nigers in Africa aiding terrorists.
"
21,7,Paul Ryan,"Mr. President, you need to be a little more careful. There's an investigation. A worker with ties to Russia was found raped and executed.
"
21,7,Garrison,"Raped and executed? Oh, you mean fucked to death? Oh yeah, that was me.
"
21,7,McConnell,"Mr. President, people are starting to question your oath to the office.
"
21,7,Garrison,"My oath to the office was that I would fuck everyone to death, remember?
"
21,7,Memberberries,"Ooo, I 'member. Me too, I 'member. I 'member that.
"
21,7,Garrison," You guys be quiet,  and you guys just get out there and put a positive spin on this whole thing.
"
21,7,McConnell,"How are we supposed to put a positive spin on it?
"
21,7,Ryan,"It's getting pretty hard to keep defending you. Maybe it's time we put our foot down.
"
21,7,Garrison,"Oooo.  Hope you brought some condoms.
"
21,7,Kyle,"Hello. I know things have been difficult between us lately. I know you think all boys are sort of pigs, but just know that a lot of us boys think girls are amazing and smart and beautiful.  Not, not like hot-beautiful, I mean like inside-beautiful. I, I'm not saying you're hot. You're not, you're not hot. I'm not saying you're ugly. It doesn't matter- you're all hot on the inside. If we could all just see inside you, it would be hot.  Oh, shit.
"
21,7,Wendy,"What do you want, Kyle?
"
21,7,Kyle,"It's Heidi Turner. You guys shouldn't criticize her so much for going with Cartman.
"
21,7,Annie,"Why not? Eric Cartman's a horrible person.
"
21,7,Kyle,"I know! I, I know that, okay? Trust me, I hate Cartman as much as any of you, but just, give her some space, you know? You can't keep on saying ""We told you so"", because if you make her feel dumb, she just doubles down and tries to prove herself that it wasn't dumb.
"
21,7,Nichole,"Why do you care? Do you like Heidi?
"
21,7,Kyle,"No!
"
21,7,Theresa,"Oh my God, he so likes Heidi.
"
21,7,Lola,"Obvi.
"
21,7,Kyle,"No I don't! ... Do I?
"
21,7,Butters," Hey, Kyle. Hey, I was thinkin' about what you said. How we should all help Heidi break up with Eric? You're right, it's our moral obligation.
"
21,7,Kyle,"Yeah, no, we're not getting involved with that.
"
21,7,Butters,"Oh, we're not?
"
21,7,Kyle,"Yeah, no, yeah, I uh dya, I think we need to stay out of it. 
"
21,7,Butters,"Oh. Okay then.
"
21,7,Kyle,"Cartman, can we talk?
"
21,7,Cartman,"Sure, Kyle. What's up? 
"
21,7,Kyle,"I just, I hope that maybe you can realize what you have with Heidi and, and just try to be good to her, okay?
"
21,7,Cartman,"Kyle, let me tell you something about relationships. There's always two sides, okay? You compromise, she compromises. Sometimes you criticize each other, but it's all part of trying to make each other better.  Someday, maybe you'll have a girlfriend and you'll understand. Oh, here she comes.  BOOM baba BOOM baba. Clear the hallway everyone, Heidi's comin' through.
"
21,7,Heidi," Wha, what are you doing, Eric?
"
21,7,Cartman,"I was just practicing marching bass drum for my buddy Kyle. It's his favorite.
"
21,7,Heidi,"Oh, okay. Um, are we still on for lunch?
"
21,7,Cartman,"You betcha, can't wait.
"
21,7,Heidi,"Okay, see ya. 
"
21,7,Cartman," BOOM baba BOOM baba BOOM!
"
21,7,Anchor Bill Keegan,"Some concern over the President's competency again today. It was during a Middle East peace conference when the President referred to the people of Saudi Arabia as a bunch of ""dirty sand Nigers"". Though the comments seem divisive, Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, says he's sticking by his President 100%. 
"
21,7,Reporter,"Speaker Ryan, it's the anniversary of the President being elected. How do you think he's doing?
"
21,7,Ryan,"Well whattaya mean? He's great. We're doing great. A lot of people judge him and just see the negative. People don't know how great the President can be behind closed doors. They don't get to see all his good qualities.
"
21,7,Reporter,"Uh huh. And is that semen on your black eye?
"
21,7,Ryan,"Oh. No, I-uh I tripped on a doorknob and uh that's just, that's doorknob cum.
"
21,7,Kyle,"You doin' okay, Heidi?
"
21,7,Heidi,"I keep thinking Eric's going to change.
"
21,7,Kyle," Heidi, people like Cartman, they always make things someone else's fault. We all wrongly see ourselves as the victims sometimes, but Cartman sees himself as the victim all the time. He'll always find someone to blame for his shortcomings, and because of that, he's never gonna change.
"
21,7,Heidi,"Before we started going out I was in a really bad place. I felt... pushed away by society. Then this guy came along who told me all the things I wanted to hear, and I just went with it. Does that make me a bad person? 
"
21,7,Kyle,"No, Heidi. Good people make bad decisions every day.
"
21,7,Heidi,"I've been defending him for so long. I don't know how I'm gonna face people if I finally give up. 
"
21,7,Cartman," Please Heidi!  Please! 
"
21,7,Cartman,"Hei-... Hei- Hei- Hei-, Hei- .... Hei-  Hei-, Hei-, Hei-
"
21,7,Tolkien," What do you want?
"
21,7,Cartman,"Hei, Hei, Heidi broke up with me, Tolkien.
"
21,7,Tolkien,"So?
"
21,7,Cartman,"I have nothing now, Tolkien. She was my whole world. Can, can I just stay here with you, please?
"
21,7,Tolkien,"What?! Why?! You still have a house!
"
21,7,Cartman,"I know how you feel now, Tolkien. To be pissed off at the world. To feel completely screwed over by society. I totally get it now. I wanna do what you guys do and go disrespect the flag and flip over cars and stuff.  Tolkien, pleeease! I'm sorry for everything! I really understand now how you guys feel! Please, what time is your family gonna go disrespect the flag and stuff? I wanna go with!
"
21,7,Tolkien,"Get outta here!
"
21,7,Linda," What's going on?
"
21,7,Tolkien," Nothing, Mom.
"
21,7,Cartman,"Heidi broke up with meeeeee.
"
21,7,Linda,"Tolkien, he's freezing.  Come on in out of the snow.
"
21,7,Cartman," Thank youuuu.
"
21,7,Tolkien,"...NO!!
"
21,7,Ryan,"Okay, we're safe to talk.
"
21,7,Pence,"It's not safe! Nowhere is safe, don't you understand?! We're all about to get killed!
"
21,7,Ryan,"Sshh, keep your voices down! Look at this!
"
21,7,Pence,"What are all these numbers?
"
21,7,Ryan,"The latest approval ratings. I've been researching our own independent poll. The President is tanking. These numbers are so low that we just might have an out. Well, don't you guys see what this means?
"
21,7,McConnell,"I don't know anything, I'm just a turtle.
"
21,7,Ryan,"It means that the swing voters are turning against him. It's those people that matter. Those are the ones who can finally turn this thing around!
"
21,7,McConnell,"And then we don't have to get killed! We can't let the President know about this. just let him- 
"
21,7,Garrison," What are you guys talkin' about?
"
21,7,Pence,"No, nothing, Mr. President.
"
21,7,Ryan,"Nothing!
"
21,7,McConnell,"No, nope!
"
21,7,Garrison,"Just having' a little chat or somethin'?
"
21,7,Pence," It's an opinion poll, Mr. President. Your numbers are down and I wanted to show you so you could do something.
"
21,7,Ryan,"Oh, you bitch!  I was the one who researched the poll, Mr. President!
"
21,7,Garrison,"Let me see that.  Huh. Isn't that interesting? But it's not a problem. See, I know something about societal psychology that you three turd balls don't. Everything's gonna be fine.
"
21,7,Cartman,"So... You guys about done with the soup?
"
21,7,Linda,"Don't you like it, Eric?
"
21,7,Cartman,"Well yeah, no, it's great. It's just- well, what time do you guys usually go out and disrespect the flag and stuff?
"
21,7,Steve,"What?
"
21,7,Cartman,"Oh no... Don't tell me you guys already disrespected the flag and flipped over cars today. Did I miss it?
"
21,7,Steve,"What the hell are you talking about?!
"
21,7,Tolkien,"I told you not to let him in.
"
21,7,Cartman,"Please, I don't know what to do with all this anger and hurt!
"
21,7,Linda,"I'm sorry your girlfriend broke up with you, Eric, but... maybe you'll get back together.
"
21,7,Cartman,"No, no, we've broken up before, but this time it's different. I can tell. Something's changed with her. Heidi won't even answer my phone calls.
"
21,7,Steve,"Heidi? Turner? The Turners' daughter?
"
21,7,Cartman,"Yeah...
"
21,7,Steve,"I thought she was with that Kyle Broflovski kid.
"
21,7,Cartman," What?
"
21,7,Steve,"I saw them at the park today holding hands.
"
21,7,Cartman," Kyle? Kyle?! Kyle!!  Kyle! Kyle! Kyle Kyle Kyle!  Kyle!  Kyle!  Kyle!  Kyle...
"
21,7,Steve,"Yeah, Kyle.
"
21,7,Cartman,"KYLE!  I should have known. You lying snake!
"
21,7,Kyle," Cartman, I didn't mean for things to happen the way they did.
"
21,7,Cartman,"Did it bother you that I was happy?! Is that why you took her from me, Kyle?!
"
21,7,Kyle,"Cartman, you weren't happy.
"
21,7,Cartman,"Shut up, Kyle!
"
21,7,Kyle,"All you did was bitch about her all the time.
"
21,7,Cartman,"You're not gonna talk your way out of this one! This is the end, Kyle! It's you or me!
"
21,7,Kyle,"Come on, Cartman. I-
"
21,7,Cartman," You took everything from me!
"
21,7,Kyle,"Stop it!
"
21,7,Cartman,"All you've ever done is work to ruin my life! Well now I'm finally gonna fight back!
"
21,7,Butters,"Fuck him up, Eric!
"
21,7,Cartman," Aaah!  Ugh!  Fuck you, Kyle!
"
21,7,Kyle,"I'm sorry, Cartman. You just have to accept that Heidi's moved on.
"
21,7,Theresa,"Guys, I just wanna say, here's to Heidi. Welcome back to the land of the living.
"
21,7,The other girls,"Yay Heidi!
"
21,7,Heidi," Thanks, guys. Thanks for taking me out. This is really fun.
"
21,7,Red,"No worries. We're just glad you finally came to your senses.
"
21,7,Annie,"Yeah, no kidding. We seriously thought you might marry that piece of shit! 
"
21,7,Heidi," Well, you know, he- he actually had some good qualities too.
"
21,7,Red,"Uhh, yeah, like what? Racism?
"
21,7,Bebe,"Or the sociopath part?
"
21,7,Isla,"Yeah. I mean, no offense, Heidi, but what the fuck were you thinking?
"
21,7,Lola,"Guys, she admitted she made a mistake.
"
21,7,Theresa,"You make a mistake on your homework. What Heidi did was more like a momentary loss of all sanity. 
"
21,7,Heidi," It was just what I believed in.
"
21,7,Bebe,"Don't worry, Heidi. We're not gonna keep telling you we told you so.
"
21,7,Lola,"But we told you so. 
"
21,7,Bebe,"The only thing I wanna know is... how did you bring yourself to actually KISS him?
"
21,7,The girls,"Eewwww!
"
21,7,Red,"Can you imagine? Eric Cartman's breath on your mouth?
"
21,7,The girls,"Ew, ugh! 
"
21,7,Isla," Heidi, come here. I want to kiss you with my tongue!
"
21,7,The girls,"Ew, ugh! 
"
21,7,Heidi,"Hi Eric.
"
21,7,Cartman,"What are you doing here?
"
21,7,Heidi,"I don't know. I think I- I just wanna make sure... you're doing okay. I want you to know I'll always care about you.
"
21,7,Cartman," That's good to know, 'cause like, nothing helps more when you're down than knowing that your girlfriend who broke up with you might care.
"
21,7,Heidi," I'm sorry that I've hurt you. I think maybe I am just stupid and I don't know what I want and it ends up hurting people.
"
21,7,Cartman,"No... You need to know something, Heidi. None of this is your fault.
"
21,7,Heidi,"But I'm the one who-
"
21,7,Cartman,"No. Heidi, none of this is your fault. There's stuff I never told you. It's time... It's time I did.
"
21,7,Heidi,"Hey.
"
21,7,Kyle,"Hey! You all set to go?
"
21,7,Heidi," I wanted to talk to you first.
"
21,7,Kyle,"Okay, sure.
"
21,7,Heidi,"Kyle, I've been under a lot of stress lately, and it was all making me really confused.
"
21,7,Kyle,"Yeah, that's understandable.
"
21,7,Heidi," I was being manipulated, and I didn't even see it. I never do. And, I don't think you saw it either, Kyle.
"
21,7,Kyle,"What do you mean?
"
21,7,Heidi,"I've come to realize that it's not my fault. It's your fault, Kyle. You made all this happen. Made me question who I was.
"
21,7,Kyle,"But Heidi, I thought-
"
21,7,Heidi," Shh.  But it's okay. You can't help it. It's how you were raised, what you were taught. My heritage is Irish, so I'm prone to being moody. And your heritage... well, you know... you can be a little sneaky sometimes and not even realize it.  I'm sorry, Kyle, but everybody's trying to live life the best they can. It's hard enough without your people always trying to get ahead. 
"
21,7,Kyle,"Dude... did she just call me a dirty Jew? 
"
21,7,"Pence, Ryan, McConnell","
Happy anniversary to you.


"
21,7,McConnell,"Cha cha cha.
"
21,7,"Pence, Ryan, McConnell","
Happy anniversary to you.


"
21,7,McConnell,"Cha cha cha.
"
21,7,"Pence, Ryan, McConnell","
Happy anniversary, Mr. President.
Happy anniversary to you.




"
21,7,Ryan,"Congratulations, Mr. President.
"
21,7,McConnell,"Looks like many more years of the same are to come.
"
21,7,Garrison,"Oh, I don't think so.  I think the next three years are gonna be even better. 
"
21,8,Steve,"Okay guys, it's November and who can tell me what that means?  Yes, Francis?
"
21,8,Francis,"It's time for the Special Ed Science Fair. 
"
21,8,Steve,"That's right, the Science Fair is this weekend, and I know you're all very excited to show the projects you've been working on.  This week we'll be hearing all about your projects and first up we have Nathan and Mimallah. 
"
21,8,Nathan,"For our science fait project, we will be showing the destructive force of nature by simulating a volcano!
"
21,8,The kids,"Ooooooh.
"
21,8,Nathan,"With vinegar and baking soda, we will make this paper-mâché volcano EXPLODE.
"
21,8,The kids,"Aaaaaaa.
"
21,8,Nathan,"With the power and fury of Mount Kilauea. Our science fair project is sure to be... a blast. Get it? A. Blast.
"
21,8,Steve,"All right, what do you guys think of Nathan and Mimallah's project idea? 
"
21,8,Nathan,"We've done it, Mimsy. We're gonna win the science fair for sure. And then, every chick in this school is gonna wanna have sex with us.
"
21,8,Mimsy,"Uh, gee boss, I don't know about sex with no chicken.
"
21,8,Nathan," Not those chicks, numbskull. I'm talkin' 'bout bitches. You know what girls like? They like winners. And when we win the science fair, we're gonna be up to our ears in pussy.
"
21,8,Wendy,"Is it just me, or are things around here getting worse and worse?
"
21,8,Millie,"It's definitely not just you. I think everyone's in shock that Heidi went back to Cartman.
"
21,8,Theresa,"What keeps driving her back to him? It's so weird.
"
21,8,Isla,"She's so... mean and angry these days.
"
21,8,Wendy,"People change. They say you become more and more like the person you're with, and I guess it's true with Heidi.
"
21,8,Heidi," Hey guys. What's up?
"
21,8,Isla," Hey, Heidi.
"
21,8,Heidi,"What are you guys talkin' about?
"
21,8,Nichole,"Nothing.
"
21,8,Heidi,"Bullcrap, you're all talkin' about me again. 'Cause you're judgmental bitches.  Ehhh.
"
21,8,Wendy,"Heidi, are you okay? It's just... you look...
"
21,8,Heidi,"I look what?
"
21,8,Wendy,"Ngh, you know, y-you just look-
"
21,8,Heidi,"What? I look fat? Is that what you wanna say, Wendy? Fuck you, bitch!
"
21,8,Theresa,"She's just concerned, Heidi.
"
21,8,Heidi," ""Mehmehmehmehmehhh, Heidi"". I'm just trying to enjoy my lunch here! Can I do it without you guys shitting on all over me?!
"
21,8,Jimmy,"All right, good, Timmy. Test 42a is successful. Let's move on to the next phase. 
"
21,8,Nathan,"Well hello, gentlemen.
"
21,8,Jimmy,"Oh hey fellas, we're doing great.
"
21,8,Timmy,"Timmih!
"
21,8,Nathan,"Thought we'd stop by to see how your- science fair project is going.
"
21,8,Mimsy,"Dah I thought we was comin' to rub their faces in how good our science fair project was, boss.
"
21,8,Nathan," Shut up, Mimsyyy!  So what are you guys workin' on?
"
21,8,Jimmy,"Oh, it's fantastic. This year, Tim-Tim and I are doin' our project on  water bears.
"
21,8,Nathan,"Oh. Water bears.  You hear that, Mimsy? Like there's any such things as water bears. That blue science fair ribbon is as good as ours.  Well, we've gotta get back to our lava volcano. Good luck finding your, pft, water bears. 
"
21,8,Jimmy,"Oh, would you like to see them?
"
21,8,Nathan," What? Uh what are you talking about?
"
21,8,Jimmy,"Timmy and I have gathered thousands of water bears. Take a look in the microscope.  Water bears are water-dwelling, eight-legged micro-animals.
"
21,8,Timmy,"Timmah.
"
21,8,Jimmy,"They're one of nature's most resilient animals.  Studies have shown they can survive lava, and even the vacuum of space.
"
21,8,Nathan,"What-? How-?  Where the fuck did you learn about these things?
"
21,8,Jimmy,"Where all good scientists learn from. Octonauts.
"
21,8,Timmy,"Octonauts!
"
21,8,Jimmy,"Some scientists believe the study of water bears is key to human survival.
"
21,8,Mimsy,"Aw jeez, that sounds a lot better than a lava volcano, huh boss?
"
21,8,Nathan,"Well, not really, because the science fair is supposed to be an experiment. I fail to see what the experiment is here.
"
21,8,Jimmy,"Oh, that's easy. You see, for the past several weeks, Tim-Tim and me have been training the water bears to respond to different sound waves. We found that they respond best to Taylor Swift. Hit it, Timmy.  Take a look.  We still have some training to do, but we're excited about the results. I have to admit, your lava volcano is pretty great too. Maybe we could tie for first place. 
"
21,8,Mackey,"Come in.
"
21,8,Heidi," You wanted to see me, Mr. Mackey?
"
21,8,Mackey,"Oh yes, Heidi, uh, we just wanted to see if you have transportation to the Special Ed Science Fair this weekend, or if you wanted us to set somethin' up for you.
"
21,8,Heidi,"What?
"
21,8,Mackey,"...Uh, Saturday is the science fair, and, you're the judge for the competition?
"
21,8,Heidi,"Judge a special needs science fair? Ahem, no thanks.
"
21,8,Mackey,"Well, Heidi, is there a problem with you bein' the judge this weekend?
"
21,8,Heidi,"Uhh, yeah? It's Saturday, and I don't wanna be at skewl?
"
21,8,Mackey,"But you're always the judge of the Special Ed Science Fair because you're our best science student.
"
21,8,Heidi,"So now I'm gonna be punished by being force to judge a bunch of handicapped kids?!
"
21,8,Mackey,"But... Okay, you see, the problem is that you volunteered last month, Heidi. You said you wanted to do it, m'kay?
"
21,8,Heidi,"Well how can you expect students to commit to things a month in advance?!  I don't even know what I want for dinner tonight.
"
21,8,Mackey,"Look, the kids have worked really hard and have done some amazing projects.
"
21,8,Heidi,"You're gonna force me to come to skewl on a Saturday?!
"
21,8,Mackey,"Heidi, eh... is everything all right?
"
21,8,Heidi,"Oh what? Are you gonna call me fat now too?! It just so happens I'm a vegan, which means it'd difficult for me to get enough protein, so my body doesn't burn fat, it burns muscle, which makes it look like I'm fat, but I'm actually WAY healthier than any of YOU!!
"
21,8,Mackey,"Heidi, you're judging the Special Ed Science Fair this weekend.
"
21,8,Heidi,"Oh, Goddammit!
"
21,8,Nathan," Mimsy! Come on! 
"
21,8,Mimsy,"Okay Nathan. 
"
21,8,Nathan,"Shhh, shut the fuck up! 
"
21,8,Mimsy,"Gee, we could get in a lot of trouble. Ya, you sure we should mess with Jimmy and Timmy's science fair project?
"
21,8,Nathan,"Mimsy, do you know what Jimmy is? He's a cock blocker.
"
21,8,Mimsy,"Eh what's a cock blocker?
"
21,8,Nathan,"Every time I come up with a way to score with the ladies, there's Jimmy tryin' to one-up me. This science fair is supposed to finally make us successful enough to get chicks.
"
21,8,Mimsy,"D'aw, gee, I don't know if we should use our position of power to exploit women.
"
21,8,Nathan,"...  I'm not letting those assholes win the science fair!  That's why I say, the only good water bears are dead water bears.  Let's go! 
"
21,8,Heidi,"This is bullcrap! How can they force me to be the science fair judge?! Now I know how it feels to be a slave!
"
21,8,Wendy,"It's... not exactly like being a slave, Heidi.
"
21,8,Heidi,"Yes it is! Am I being paid to judge the science fair? No. Do I have a choice? No. ""Ohhh, yes masah. Lemme judge that science fair for ya, suh!""
"
21,8,Theresa,"God, will you stop?!
"
21,8,Heidi,"Theresa, don't get all aggro on me because you're pissed off your family lives in a trailer.
"
21,8,Theresa,"My family doesn't live in a trailer. We live in a tiny home. My parents downsized to make a smaller footprint on the environment.
"
21,8,Heidi,"That's what I said. Your family lives in a trailer.
"
21,8,Theresa,"There's lots of progressive people living in tiny homes. There's five others on my block.
"
21,8,Heidi,"Right. That's called a ""trailer park.""
"
21,8,Theresa," A-hi don't live in a trailer park!
"
21,8,Wendy," Just don't even respond to her. Just ignore her.
"
21,8,Heidi,"I'll try, but she's such a bitch.
"
21,8,Isla,"She wasn't talking to you, Heidi.
"
21,8,Heidi,"Oh, looks like Isla has something to say, you guys. Hold on, I'm sure this is going to be really profound. Go ahead, Isla, knock us out with you wit and satire. This should be good, you guys.
"
21,8,Cartman," Hey Heidi, what's up?
"
21,8,Heidi," Oh hey babe, what's going on?
"
21,8,Cartman,"What are you up to?
"
21,8,Heidi," Nothiiing, just talking to my girlfriends about tiny homes.
"
21,8,Nathan,"Well hello there, ladies.
"
21,8,Nelly,"Oh, hi Nathan.
"
21,8,Nathan,"We just wanted to remind you  that this weekend is the Special Ed Science Fair.
"
21,8,Nichole,"Oh, cool.
"
21,8,Nathan,"Yeah, that's right. Pretty soon you'll all be impressed with what you see. Hope you can make it.  Did you see that, Mimsy? The way those girls bit their bottom lips when I said ""science fair""? We're about to be drowning in muff.
"
21,8,Francis,"Nathan! Mimallah! Yuh, you've gotta get to Special Ed!
"
21,8,Nathan,"Special Ed class isn't for another two hours.
"
21,8,Francis,"Nono, you've gotta see this! Jimmy and Timmy's water bears! They've changed!
"
21,8,Nathan,"What?
"
21,8,Steve,"Jimmy and Timmy, this is incredible! You've somehow made them even smarter. 
"
21,8,Nathan,"What's goin' on?
"
21,8,Jimmy,"Nathan, it's amazing. The water bears we've trained are starting to display social advancements.
"
21,8,Mimsy,"But they're supposed to be dead. 
"
21,8,Nathan," What social advancement?
"
21,8,Jimmy,"They've actually evolved to the point of doing the hokey pokey.
"
21,8,Nathan,"The hokey pokey?  You've gotta be fucking kidding me.
"
21,8,Steve,"Boys, this might be the single greatest Special Ed Science Fair project I've ever seen!
"
21,8,Heidi,"Butters.
"
21,8,Butters,"Whoa.  Uh hey.
"
21,8,Heidi,"How would you like to be the judge for the Special Ed Science Fair this weekend?
"
21,8,Butters,"Uhh, I can't. I'm going to a birthday party.
"
21,8,Cartman,"Butters, don't be a dick!
"
21,8,Heidi,"Yeah, don't make up excuses because judging handicapped students sounds terrible!
"
21,8,Cartman,"Yeah, Butters! God! 
"
21,8,Clyde," He's not making it up. It's my birthday party.
"
21,8,Cartman,"Well then, could you invite Heidi, please? She needs an excuse not to have to go to the Special Needs Science Fair.
"
21,8,Stan," What's wrong with supporting them? They're our friends.
"
21,8,Heidi,"Because nobody wants to be trapped, in a gym, with Special Ed Science.
"
21,8,Kyle,"Actually, some of their projects are pretty cool.
"
21,8,"Cartman, and Heidi","Shut up, Kyle!  Samesies! 
"
21,8,Heidi,"Look, it's all just a complete waste of time! It's not like the Special Ed Science Fair is actually gonna contribute to society. 
"
21,8,Jerry Jones," Move. Move aside, kids. Official business!
"
21,8,An NFL owner,"Move it, children. 
"
21,8,PC Principal,"Excuse me, can I help you?
"
21,8,Jerry Jones,"We understand that you're about to have a science fair with some very interesting experiments.
"
21,8,PC Principal,"That's right, the science fair is this Saturday from 10 am to 2 pm.
"
21,8,Jerry Jones,"We're here to help however we can. Your special ed department has all our resources and all our support. This science fair... just might be what saves us all.
"
21,8,Heidi,"What the hell is going on?! Everywhere I turn, people are being given handouts while I'm forced to work my ass off! It's total bullshit!
"
21,8,Cartman,"Yeah... uh... Babe, uh I understand that you're pissed off, but, um, you know, it is recess. Maybe we should relax and have some fun?
"
21,8,Heidi," Relax?! How can I relax?! I get straight A's! I ace every test! And who gets all the support?! The Special Ed Department!
"
21,8,Jerry Jones,"Good. Bring it on in. These kids need to have access to everything they need.
"
21,8,Jimmy,"Wow, look at this, Tim-Tim. They've all been researching water bears too.
"
21,8,Jerry Jones,"That's correct.  Like you, we've come to realize that water bears are the key to our future.  Are these the special water bears that we read about on your school message board?
"
21,8,Jimmy,"That's right. The water bears we've been working with appear to be evolving somehow.
"
21,8,Jerry Jones,"Then they are the key to our survival, boys.
"
21,8,Nathan,"Gentlemen, perhaps I can interest you in a lava volcano. You won't believe your eyes when I add some simple baking soda.
"
21,8,Jerry Jones," There's no time for that! We need everyone working on Jimmy and Timmy's project. I'm gonna let you kids all in on a little secret. We don't wanna create a panic, but... the End is very near. And we have very little time.
"
21,8,Heidi,"Fellow students, I have asked to speak today because of the hypocrisy and bullying that is coming from the administration at this so called... skewl. It is an outrage that our principal and counselor demand our participation in privileged programs that are outrageously overfunded. Why is it that the school allows funding that only goes to special needs students? Are the rest of us not special? If we are continually asked to work for no money and ask our parents to pay for our programs, then soon we will all be poor, and forced to live in a trailer park like Theresa.
"
21,8,Theresa,"It's not a trailer!
"
21,8,Heidi,"Theresa,  get over it, you live in a trailer park, it's not a big deal. 
"
21,8,Cartman,"Uh, o-okay honey, you're kind of getting off-topic, sweetie.
"
21,8,Heidi,"What did you say?!
"
21,8,Cartman,"Uh just, uh-uhm, I just want you to stay on point so we can get this over with.
"
21,8,Heidi,"GET THIS OVER WITH?! You're supposed to be supporting me!
"
21,8,Cartman,"I am supporting you, sweetheart!
"
21,8,Heidi,"Being supportive doesn't mean you criticize me, asshole! Just forget it! My point is, if the school administration doesn't cancel the science fair, I will see to it that they are all fired for discrimination!
"
21,8,Mackey," She's... kind of like Cartman, but with the ability to follow through.
"
21,8,PC Principal,"Oh, dude. Bro.
"
21,8,Jimmy,"Francis, can you hand me the sound wave generator? 
"
21,8,Nathan,"This is bullshit! The Special Ed Science Fair is turning into a lovefest for Jimmy and Timmy's project! They're gonna get all the fame and glory!
"
21,8,Mimsy,"D'aw, I guess we kind of shot ourselves in the foot, huh boss? If it weren't for us, those water bears wouldn't have even gotten smarter in the first place.
"
21,8,Nathan," Hey, Mimsy, that's right. They don't deserve the credit, we do.  Uh, excuse me. If you're all trying to figure out why these water bears are different, you're talking to the wrong guys. 
"
21,8,Jimmy,"Wha-what do you mean, Nathan?
"
21,8,Nathan,"Mimsy and I did some experimenting with the water bears on our own.
"
21,8,Mimsy,"We was tryin' to kill 'em. 
"
21,8,Nathan,"It was us who made them evolve, so we should be the ones working for the government.
"
21,8,Jerry Jones,"The government? Wuh we aren't the government.
"
21,8,Jimmy,"Yuh you're not the government? But you said you were here to help stop us from becoming extinct.
"
21,8,Jerry Jones,"Not you, us. We're with... the NFL. Our fans are leaving at an exponential rate. We've been hit with anthem protests, protests of those protests, and worst of all, concussions. The more reports that come out, the more people are getting turned off by football. We've been experimenting with water bears because... we believe they are our last hope.
"
21,8,Jimmy,"Oh, I get it. You've been experimenting with water bears to see how to make humans more impervious to concussions.
"
21,8,Jerry Jones,"No. We've been experimenting with water bears to try and make them... FANS.
"
21,8,Sportscaster 1,"A beautiful night for football here in Los Angeles as the Chargers take on the Buffalo Bills.
"
21,8,Sportscaster 2,"And a record sellout crowd here at the stadium. Football clearly more popular than over with a whopping 17 million in attendance. 
"
21,8,Sportscaster 1,"The NFL, of course, working really hard to reach new viewers, and it looks like they found their answer in tardigrades.
"
21,8,Sportscaster 2," The water bears are thrilled to be here and of course, love seeing themselves on the Jumbotron.  They're all ready for some football and enjoying the fan favorite Kiss Cam. 
"
21,8,Sportscaster 1,"And we're ready for kickoff as the cheers of 17 million fans rock the stadium! 
"
21,8,Jerry Jones,"We're running out of time. We have to see if these water bears truly are different. Insert the box.  Gently. What do you see now? 
"
21,8,Nathan,"Ahhh, Iii see the box.  What, what's in the box?
"
21,8,Jerry Jones,"What are the water bears doing?
"
21,8,Nathan,"Uhhh, they're just walkin' around and ubb, oh wait! They appear to be interested in the box.
"
21,8,Jerry Jones,"These water bears are different. 
"
21,8,PC Principal,"All right, everyone, listen up. Give me your attention please. Due to circumstances beyond our control, we are cancelling the Special Ed Science Fair. 
"
21,8,Owners,"What? Cancelling?
"
21,8,Jerry Jones,"You can't cancel the science fair. We're on the verge of a breakthrough here.
"
21,8,Heidi,"It's cancelled. You guys can get all this shit out of here and leave. Thank you!
"
21,8,Jerry Jones,"You don't understand! The Special Ed Science Fair is our only hope!
"
21,8,Mr. Mackey,"Oh I'm sorry, but um, our hands are tied... by Heidi. 
"
21,8,Jerry Jones,"I think you all fail to see the seriousness of our situation! Football is dying!
"
21,8,Mr. Mackey," Whoa, whoa whoa, okay.
"
21,8,Jerry Jones," Close the door!  Everyone back to work! Nobody...  will stop this Special Ed Science Fair!
"
21,8,Another owner," Do what he says!
"
21,8,Nathan,"Oh! Uh okay, Jesus Christ!
"
21,8,Heidi," Are you just gonna stand there?! Do something!
"
21,8,Cartman,"What the hell do you want me to do?!
"
21,8,Heidi,"I want you to have some BALLS and act like you care about me!
"
21,8,Cartman,"Heidi, you need to stop being such a bitch!
"
21,8,Heidi," Call me a bitch again! Do it!  Call me a bitch again!
"
21,8,Cartman,"You are... acting... like a... bad girlfriend.
"
21,8,Heidi,"That's what I thought!
"
21,8,Nathan,"Hey, uh wait a minute! The water bears have changed again. I think it's working.
"
21,8,Jerry Jones,"Let me see that!  Yes. Yes, they're starting to adapt.  Sonofabitch, we just might have ourselves some fans!  Now quickly, children! We must replicate these water bears to create more! 
"
21,8,Heidi,"If nobody else is going to do anything, I will! 
"
21,8,Nathan,"Wha-ah?
"
21,8,An owner,"The water bears!
"
21,8,Cartman,"Heidi! Heidi, will you please listen to me?!
"
21,8,Heidi,"Move it! Get the fuck out of the way! I said get out of the way, you assholes! 
"
21,8,Another owner,"We got the fat girl, front of the school.
"
21,8,Heidi,"Shit! 
"
21,8,Jerry Jones,"Little girl, stop!  It doesn't have to end this way.
"
21,8,Cartman," Move aside! Move aside!  Heidi, seriously, you need to listen to me!
"
21,8,Heidi,"I don't... have to listen... to anybody!
"
21,8,Cartman,"Yes, yes you do! You need to listen!
"
21,8,Heidi,"Fuck you!
"
21,8,Cartman,"No, fuck you!
"
21,8,Jerry Jones,"Little girl, please! What you have in your hand is very special.
"
21,8,Heidi,"Well I'm sick of everyone treating me like shit!
"
21,8,Jerry Jones,"Think about the NFL. How much joy it brings to everyone!
"
21,8,Nathan,"Don't listen to them. Give the water bears to me. I deserve all the fame and bitches.
"
21,8,Cartman,"Heidi, you've gotta stop being so angry.
"
21,8,Jerry Jones,"Look, if you- if you don't do it for the NFL, what about humanity? Those creatures are showing the first signs of sentience. Think about what they could mean for science. For medicine. Making people better.
"
21,8,Cartman,"Come on, babe. We all want the old Heidi back. 
"
21,8,Heidi," Screw all you guys!
"
21,8,"NFL Owners, Special Ed kids","NOOOO! 
"
21,8,Cartman,"Dude, wwow.
"
21,8,Heidi," Is there something you wanna talk about?
"
21,8,Cartman,"No. I was just... trying to... figure out why you decided to drink 20,000 microanimals that were showing signs of intelligence.
"
21,8,Heidi,"Whatever. It's Saturday, and I'm not in skewl.
"
21,8,Cartman,"Yeah, you're, you're not in skewl.
"
21,8,Heidi," How come we never snuggle anymore?!
"
21,8,Cartman," Wha, what?
"
21,8,Heidi,"We used to snuggle all the time and it's totally gone away! What happened?!
"
21,8,Cartman,"Well, but honey, we still-
"
21,8,Heidi,"SNUGGLE!
"
21,8,Cartman," Yes yes, let's, let's snuggle, yes. 
"
21,8,Heidi,"Goddammit, how come there's nothin' to watch on Saturday but kids cartoons?!
"
21,8,Blue Horse on TV,"Hohall right, kids. Now let's do the hokey pokey. 
"
21,8,Heidi,"Oooo.  What's goin' on in here?
"
21,8,Cartman,"Oh, what is goin' on in here?
"
21,8,Heidi,"I feel somethin' moving around. I-it- 
"
21,8,Cartman,"Yeesh. 
"
21,8,Heidi," SNUGGLE!
"
21,8,Cartman,"Okay, okay, honey.  Eughah, ah.
"
21,8,Roger Goodell,"Well, did you have any luck, Mr. Jones?
"
21,8,Jerry Jones,"I'm afraid, Commissioner, that the Special Ed Science Fair failed to produce more viable water bears.
"
21,8,Official 1,"Then the NFL truly has no hope.
"
21,8,Official 2,"We're done for.
"
21,8,Jerry Jones,"Not quite.  We were able to obtain somethin' else  that just might be our future. 
"
21,8,Goodell and the officials,"Ooohhhh!
"
21,9,Netflix President,"Welcome to Netflix.  Last year we approved 16 original shows and movies; and this year, it is our goal to make that number 1,087. That's why we here at Netflix are thrilled to be working with you two comedy geniuses, Terrance & Phillip.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Classic stuff. Now go ahead and pitch what you're thinking for your Netflix original series.
"
21,9,Terrance,"Well, we were thinkin' that we'd do a show where Phillip and I are on a farm... with a cow.
"
21,9,President," Okay, I love it so far.
"
21,9,Terrance," The sun is just starting to come up and then... I fart on Phillip.
"
21,9,Phillip," And I say, ""Terrance, you farted,"" and I fart on Terrance.
"
21,9,President,"And it's like a back and forth kind of thing? It's sort of like a-?
"
21,9,Phillip," It's like a back and forth kind of thing. I fart on him, he farts on...
"
21,9,President,"On you. Got it!
"
21,9,Phillip,"No! On the cow. 
"
21,9,President,"Welcome to Netflix, you sons of bitches. YEAH!
"
21,9,Terrance & Phillip,"Hooray!
"
21,9,Craig,"Come on, Tweek. Hurry!
"
21,9,Stan,"What's going on?
"
21,9,Tweek," Cartman and his girlfriend are fighting again. 
"
21,9,Cartman,"Oh. Uh. Oh. Ugh! Goddamn!  Oh. Sweetheart!
"
21,9,Heidi,"Piece of shit! 
"
21,9,Cartman,"Honey, I wanna watch Terrance & Phillip with my friends!
"
21,9,Heidi,"You promised we'd have a date night! 
"
21,9,Cartman,"It's just one night, babe. Stan is having a viewing party, honey. 
"
21,9,Heidi,"So then why can't I come?
"
21,9,Cartman,"Terrance & Phillip is a guys' night thing, baby.
"
21,9,Kyle," Uh, hey, hey, hey! What the hell are you all doing?
"
21,9,Wendy,"Watching Heidi get her bitch-ass kicked!
"
21,9,Heidi,"Fuck you, Wendy!
"
21,9,Craig,"Don't take that crap, Heidi! Let Cartman have it!
"
21,9,Kyle,"Guys! Guys, this has gone on way too long. Can't we all stop being so mean to each other? 
"
21,9,Heidi,"Shut up, Kyle. You sound like your mom. 
"
21,9,Cartman,"Th- that was awesome, baby. I love you. 
"
21,9,Heidi,"I love you too, babe.
"
21,9,Kids,"Awww. 
"
21,9,Craig,"Dammit.
"
21,9,Butters,"Fight's over. Kyle ruined it. 
"
21,9,PC Principal,"Alright everyone, listen up. As you know, there's been a lot of bullying and insensitivity at our school. To counteract this, it is my firm belief that South Park Elementary is in desperate need of a strong woman. So in looking for a new vice principal, we wanted to find a powerful, intelligent, and independent female to be a role model for us all. And with that said, I'd like to introduce our new vice principal, Strong Woman. 
"
21,9,Strong Woman,"Thank you, PC Principal. Alright everyone, listen up. I'm the new vice principal of this school. My name is Strong Woman. I've already spent a few days here at the school watching and observing and we definitely have things we can all be working on. 
"
21,9,PC Principal," Hey! Stotch! You do not disrespect Strong Woman by talking when she's talking!
"
21,9,Strong Woman,"You really think I couldn't have handled that? Myself?
"
21,9,PC Principal,"Oh. Uh, I was just making sure everything was uh-
"
21,9,Strong Woman,"You really had to grab the mic out of my hand like that?
"
21,9,PC Principal,"Shit. I mean, no, sorry, sorry, I'm not u-, uh, here you go. 
"
21,9,Strong Woman,"I want the girls here at this school to know that they can talk to me about anything, but I also want the boys to know what I'm looking for is a better place for everybody.  Turning this school around is going to take work from everyone.
"
21,9,PC Principal,"From everyone!
"
21,9,Strong Woman," Sorry, am I not doing this correctly?
"
21,9,PC Principal,"No. NO! Sorry, I thought I'd... add, just add for emphasis.
"
21,9,Strong Woman,"You felt it wasn't strong enough? Me just saying it?
"
21,9,PC Principal,"No-I, I'm... Uh, I'm sorry.
"
21,9,Strong Woman," I'm looking forward to being your vice principal, and I'm looking forward to turning this school around.
"
21,9,PC Principal," Alright, now if we have any q-
"
21,9,Strong Woman,"I'm not finished!
"
21,9,PC Principal," Right, right, uh, I'm sorry. Every- pay attention everybody!
"
21,9,Announcer 1,"It's the Terrance & Phillip Sho-o-ow.
"
21,9,Announcer 2,"On Netflix. 
"
21,9,Phillip,"Hey Terrance, what did the black lawyer say to the Muslim priest?
"
21,9,Terrance,"I don't know, Phillip. What? 
"
21,9,Stan,"Come in!
"
21,9,Cartman," Did we miss it?
"
21,9,Stan,"It's just starting.
"
21,9,Heidi,"Oh look, honey. Kyle's mom is here. Shouldn't you be at temple, Ms. Broflovski? 
"
21,9,Canadian Mexican," Hola. Would you like to buy some chimichangas?
"
21,9,Terrance,"Si, mi amigo.  Here, I'll give you two pesos. 
"
21,9,Heidi,"Dude, that's awesome.
"
21,9,Stan," What, what's wrong, dude.
"
21,9,Kyle,"For the first time I feel kind of bad for the person being farted on.
"
21,9,Heidi,"Uf, Kyle's mom doesn't like the cartoon, guys. Better shut it off. 
"
21,9,Cartman,"Baby, I fuckin' love you so much.
"
21,9,PC Principal,"Alright, everyone. Listen up. As you all know, we've been looking for a strong woman to take on the role of vice principal at this school. We couldn't be happier with the selection we've made and we're sure she'll be making our school a better place. So with that let me turn over the floor to our new vice principal, Strong Woman. 
"
21,9,Strong Woman,"Thanks everyone. Alright, listen up.  I fully appreciate that some of you might be uncomfortable with me being here. Earlier today, I noticed that some faculty weren't sure whether to call me ""Miss Woman"" or just ""Strong."" If I were a man, you'd probably address me as Vice Principal Woman, so why should it be any different, huh? We good?
"
21,9,Mr. Mackey,"Uhm'kay.
"
21,9,Strong Woman,"So I've been getting to know some of the students here and I'm definitely hearing a lot of frustration and confusion over issues that all the schools are facing right now. I also spent some time observing in the cafeteria and was pretty shocked by the abusive and intolerant language.  Not sure if any of you have noticed, but a lot of the girls are eating their lunches out on the playground to avoid being around the toxic environment that's been created. It's my intention to make the cafeteria... P.E. class is another huge problem at this school. The girls' gym outfits seem not to have been updated since the '60s. We have a lot of work to do here. I intend to do it quickly. 
"
21,9,Mr. Mackey,"Excuse me uh, I'm sorry, but uh, is anyone else hearing Hootie & The Blowfish like, very very softly?
"
21,9,Substitute Teacher,"Yeah, yeah, I hear it.
"
21,9,Strong Woman," It's, it's coming from over here somewhere.
"
21,9,PC Principal,"E-excuse me everyone, I um, I need to get to the restroom. Sorry, I'll be right back. 
"
21,9,The Preacher,"Therefore what God hath joined together let no man  Oh! 
"
21,9,Michael Jackson,"That's it. That's it, Kyle.  No more. No more of them doody jokes.  No more watching cartoons of people, people having go doody.  And poo-pooing on each other's heads.  It's not funny anymore, is it, Kyle? 
"
21,9,Doctor,"Hello there, misterr... Principal, is it?
"
21,9,PC Principal,"That's right, I'm PC Principal.
"
21,9,Doctor,"Hm what's bringing you in today?
"
21,9,PC Principal,"I'm uh... having this problem with my ears. There's like a persistent kind of ahh ringing going on.
"
21,9,Doctor," O-kay, can you describe the ringing?
"
21,9,PC Principal,"It's um, Hootie & The Blowfish.
"
21,9,Doctor,"You're hearing a song? 
"
21,9,PC Principal,"Yeah, uh, ahem, there's a new woman that has joined our faculty. Her name is Strong Woman, and uh, she seems to have set off some kind of device in my ears.
"
21,9,Doctor,"So maybe you're having some feelings for her.
"
21,9,PC Principal,"No, that couldn't be it. We work in the same place, so it would be impossible for me to like her. I'm thinking there's some sort of device in my ears.
"
21,9,Doctor,"Well, I looked, and Hootie & The Blowfish aren't in your ears. I believe you're hearing them in your mind and your heart.
"
21,9,PC Principal,"Oh, dude. Bro.
"
21,9,Strong Woman,"You may enter. 
"
21,9,Kyle,"Vice Principal Woman?
"
21,9,Strong Woman,"Yes?  What can I do for you?
"
21,9,Kyle,"My name's Kyle, and I've been doing a lot of changing lately. I came because I might be able to offer some... insight into our problem here.
"
21,9,Strong Woman,"Please, by all means.
"
21,9,Kyle,"You see, there's a culture at this school that embraces meanness, and I believe now that it comes from a Canadian TV show. All the boys watch it. I did too. We all laughed while they... farted... on innocent people's heads. The thing is, I never felt for the person being farted on. Until now. I want to work with you to open people's eyes, because I get it now.
"
21,9,Strong Woman," You want to blame farts? That seems kind of ridiculous, doesn't it?
"
21,9,Kyle,"What?
"
21,9,Strong Woman,"I mean, it's a slippery slope when we start pointing the finger at our own shortcomings.
"
21,9,Kyle,"But, but I thought for sure YOU would be on my side.
"
21,9,Strong Woman,"Kind of sounds like something my mother would say, actually.
"
21,9,Kyle,"What?? D'oh, forget it! 
"
21,9,Cartman,"May I have your attention please? Mrs. Broflovski, your tampons are available at the front desk. Mrs. Broflovski, your tampons are available at the front desk. Thank you. 
"
21,9,Heidi," Come on, we've gotta get out of here.
"
21,9,Kyle,"Rrrrr!
"
21,9,Mr. Mackey,"You wanted to see me, PC Principal?
"
21,9,PC Principal,"Uh YES. Yes, Mackey, um, I just wanted to see how you thought it was going with Strong Woman.
"
21,9,Mr. Mackey,"Well, she seems to be acclimating fine, ukay, the kids really respect her.
"
21,9,PC Principal,"Do you know, uh,  Do you know if Strong Woman has a boyfriend?
"
21,9,Mr. Mackey,"What??
"
21,9,PC Principal,"No-nothing. Just forget it. 
"
21,9,Mr. Mackey,"Are you out of your fuckin' mind?! Askin' if a coworker is available in today's times?!
"
21,9,PC Principal,"I just wanted to know because she's unavailable, then maybe I can get my head off of her, alright?
"
21,9,Mr. Mackey,"Oh boy, this is bad! This is real bad!
"
21,9,PC Principal," I don't know how it happened. I know it's inappropriate and yet I can't stop thinking about her. I think I'm... sick.
"
21,9,Mr. Mackey,"Look, this is real fucking fire you're dealing with, uhkay?! I'm gonna get someone down here from HR!
"
21,9,PC Principal,"HR? Is that like... Hootie Removal?
"
21,9,Mr. Mackey,"No! Human resources! The people that come in to make sure everything's kept on the level! We gotta get you back on track!
"
21,9,Anchor Tom,"Is Canada a bad influence on the United States? A group of young people called ""Millennials Against Canada"" thinks so, and we are joined by their leader, Kyle Broflovski.
"
21,9,Kyle,"Thanks for having me, Tom.
"
21,9,Anchor Tom,"Young man, you say Canada is to blame for most of our problems.
"
21,9,Kyle,"All I'm saying is that there's a culture that originates from Canada which is at least partly to blame for the state of our country now.
"
21,9,Anchor Tom,"To respond to this we're now joined by the Canadian Minister of Streaming.
"
21,9,Minister of Streaming,"Thanks for having me, buddeh.
"
21,9,Anchor Tom,"Minister, how do you answer to these angry millennials?
"
21,9,Minister of Streaming,"Well, they're pissed off because their country sucks, so they wanna point the finger at us.
"
21,9,Kyle,"I'm saying we're all guilty too. I grew up watching Terrance & Phillip, and I thought it was funny.
"
21,9,Minister of Streaming,"So you thought it was funny, but now it's not funny?
"
21,9,Kyle,"No, it was never funny. I see it differently now.
"
21,9,Minister of Streaming,"Oh, so you want to censor it.
"
21,9,Kyle,"We don't wanna censor it, we just wanna... get rid of it.
"
21,9,Minister of Streaming,"Uh huh, you sound like a Jewish mother.
"
21,9,Kyle,"Oh, see? That's what I'm talking about, right there! That kind of mean, degrading, Canadian trash!
"
21,9,Minister of Streaming,"Now I resent that! I find that racist-
"
21,9,Kyle,"Canadians should care about the rest of the world!
"
21,9,Minister of Streaming,"You are a racist, fwiend, and if you have a problem with Canada, maybe you should speak to your backwards President!
"
21,9,Kyle,"Maybe I will!
"
21,9,Minister of Streaming,"'Kay, go ahead!
"
21,9,Kyle,"Maybe I know the President!
"
21,9,Minister of Streaming,"Oh, sure you do! Just like all Jewish moms, 'cause you don't understand how-
"
21,9,Kyle,"Stop calling me that!
"
21,9,Minister of Streaming,"Can I finish?!
"
21,9,Kyle,"That's all you know is how to be mean-
"
21,9,Minister of Streaming,"That's not a- Can I finish, please?!
"
21,9,Kyle,"Because you were all raised on it yourselves!
"
21,9,Minister of Streaming,"Please, can I finish?!  Alright, I'm finished.
"
21,9,PC Principal,"Alright, everyone. Listen up. As you know, we want to provide a safe work environment for all our employees. Sometimes feelings do arise and we are tempted by the Devil to act upon them. So we've been reaching out to Human Resources division as I think we can all use someone to tell us about what is and isn't considered misconduct. She has some great advice for us, so please welcome Heather Conduct. Go ahead, Miss Conduct.
"
21,9,Miss Conduct,"Hello, everyone, my name is Miss Conduct. I'm hear to talk about making sure we avoid any trouble at this school. M'alright?
"
21,9,Mr. Mackey," Uh m'kay.
"
21,9,Miss Conduct,"M'alright. Now, by a show of hands, who's ever had inappropriate feelings for a coworker? 
"
21,9,Phillip,"Well hello there, little girl.
"
21,9,Terrance,"Are you selling girl scout cookies?
"
21,9,Girl,"Well yes I am. How about a Snickerdoodle?
"
21,9,Phillip,"Alright, you asked for it.  Oh! Oh, I think I shit my pants.
"
21,9,Kyle," Alright! That's it! Everyone stop! We're shutting it down!  We are Millennials Against Canada. We demand this kind of bullying Canadian entertainment be stopped!
"
21,9,Terrance,"Didn't think I'd live long enough to see this all happen again.
"
21,9,Anchor Tom,"More and more millennials are turning into Jewish mothers today as they demand the censorship of entertainment. The protesters say they're not giving up and are demanding to speak with the President of the United States.
"
21,9,M.A.C. Protester 1," Here you go. Call is coming in on your phone.
"
21,9,Kyle,"Good. Give it here.  Yes, hello? This is the leader of Millennials Against Canada.
"
21,9,Stan," Kyle, what the fuck are you doing? 
"
21,9,Kyle,"Oh, I'm sorry I'm taking a stand and doing something. I realize this doesn't gel with your nihilism!
"
21,9,Stan,"Okay, dude. I didn't wanna have to say this, but you're really starting to sound like your mom.
"
21,9,Kyle,"I'm not like my mom! I'm gonna make a difference! It's gonna feel real good!
"
21,9,Tweek," Kyle! Kyle! Don't do this, man! You can't mess with this shit while You Know Who is in office! We're all gonna die!
"
21,9,Miss Conduct,"M'alright, so now everyone, we're gonna do some role-playing, m'alright? Talk about appropriate ways we can talk in the workplace. Can I, can I get a volunteer to role-play with me? M'alright?  How about you, Mr. uh... 
"
21,9,Mr. Mackey,"Mr. Mackey.
"
21,9,Miss Conduct,"M'alright, come on up here.  M'alright now, we're just gonna pretend it's a normal mornin' before work, and we're startin' the day.  Oh, Mr. Mackey. Good mornin'!
"
21,9,Mr. Mackey," Good morning, uh, Miss Conduct.
"
21,9,Miss Conduct,"Now, did you have a nice night?
"
21,9,Mr. Mackey,"Yeah, yeah it was good.
"
21,9,Miss Conduct,"M'alright. Okay. Uh good luck today, and I hope that our workin' relationship can continue to be honest and straightforward.
"
21,9,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, ah I'm very open and honest, I promise you that.
"
21,9,Miss Conduct,"I can see that. You got very honest eyes, m'alright.  M'alright, I probably shouldn't have said ""You have honest eyes"", m'alright. That's a big crossin' the line, commentin' on his physical attributes, m'alright? That's bad. I'm gonna stick to just talkin' about work only, m'alright?  So, uh, Mr. Mackey, what methods do you use for counseling the students?
"
21,9,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, I mostly use a semi-cognitive approach adapted by Kiezrick Solomon.
"
21,9,Miss Conduct,"Wow, you studied Solomon? He was actually my thesis in college.
"
21,9,Mr. Mackey,"Are you serious? Nobody I talked to has ever even heard of him!
"
21,9,Miss Conduct,"No! Same here! What made you attracted to his work?
"
21,9,Mr. Mackey,"Well it's just such a na-natural approach, m'kay?
"
21,9,Miss Conduct,"M'alright, m'alright.
"
21,9,Mr. Mackey,"When I read it, you know, first I was like ""whoa, okay!""
"
21,9,Miss Conduct,"M'alright.
"
21,9,Mr. Mackey,"""This just really makes sense"", you know?
"
21,9,Miss Conduct," Well, m'alright.
"
21,9,Mr. Mackey,"Mmmm'kay
"
21,9,Miss Conduct,"M'alright. 
"
21,9,Minister of Streaming,"Mr. President! You need to do something about your millennials!
"
21,9,President Garrison," What do you want me to do?
"
21,9,Minister of Streaming,"Terrance & Phillip are Canada's largest export! They account for 80% of our gross national product! If your citizens mess with them, they mess with all of us!
"
21,9,Garrison,"Look, I'm President of the United States. I can't get involved in every petty little protest against a third-world country.
"
21,9,Minister of Streaming,"Third-world country?!  How dare you! Canada is second-world at least!  Now you listen here, Mr. Buddeh! Either you stop the embargo on The Terrance & Phillip Show, or we'll bring in our own troops to stop it ourselves!
"
21,9,Garrison,"Are you threatening us, you beady-eyed Canuck?
"
21,9,Minister of Streaming,"I'm simply telling you that Canada will do what it must to protect itself!
"
21,9,Garrison,"Then I guess both our countries better be prepared.
"
21,9,Mr. Mackey,"And then, you know, I was-I was looking to get away from the city.  I've never really been a city person.
"
21,9,Miss Conduct,"M'alright, m'alright, I definitely get that, m'alright.
"
21,9,Mr. Mackey," I like hikin' around, bein' around in nature, m'kay.
"
21,9,Miss Conduct,"No, I agree, I agree, the city's bad. I love hikin' too. What are some of your favorite places?
"
21,9,Mr. Mackey,"Well, you know, Mt. Evens is always nice.
"
21,9,Miss Conduct," M'alright, m'alright. 
"
21,9,Strong Woman,"What the hell is that?
"
21,9,Mr. Adler," There's some kind of... military alert going out.
"
21,9,PC Principal," All right, military alert, everyone! Let's get to the hallways and get the students to the gymnasium! Come on, let's move!
"
21,9,M.A.C. Protester 2," It's the National Guard.
"
21,9,Kyle,"The National Guard?
"
21,9,M.A.C. Protester 1,"It's the President. He wants to talk to you. 
"
21,9,Kyle,"Yes. This is Millennials Against Canada.
"
21,9,Garrison,"Yeah, listen, this thing's kind of escalating. You people need to call it quits.
"
21,9,Kyle,"We can't do that, Mr. President. Someone has to do what's right.
"
21,9,Garrison,"What exactly do you want?
"
21,9,Kyle,"What do I want? I want a world... where laughter doesn't come at someone else's expense. Where people can live freely without fear of being farted on. I want a world where you aren't ridiculed for trying to help. A world where a nice girl that I liked isn't turned into another Eric Cartman! These Canadians are in the way of that world, and everything they do and everything they have done needs to be erased from the Earth!
"
21,9,Garrison,"Jeez, I got a little chub.
"
21,9,Strong Woman,"Let's go! Everyone to the gymnasium now!
"
21,9,PC Principal,"You heard her! Move it, people!  I have to make sure all the classes are empty. You go take cover with the kids.
"
21,9,Strong Woman,"I'm coming too. I'm your vice principal.
"
21,9,PC Principal,"Alright, come on!  Oh no.
"
21,9,Strong Woman,"What's wrong?
"
21,9,PC Principal,"Vice Principal Woman, I need to ask you something.
"
21,9,Strong Woman,"Okay?
"
21,9,PC Principal,"This is very difficult, but, uh...
"
21,9,Strong Woman,"What? What?
"
21,9,PC Principal," Well, as you can see, there's a door in front of us.
"
21,9,Strong Woman,"Yes, there is.
"
21,9,PC Principal,"I would like to open this door for you. However, I understand the gender-based biases this can imply.
"
21,9,Strong Woman,"Why do you need to open the door?
"
21,9,PC Principal,"I don't need to open the door. I'd just be opening it and holding it the same way I would for Counselor Mackey, a student, anyone else.
"
21,9,Strong Woman,"Somebody's gonna have to open the door, or we could die out here.
"
21,10,Crystal,"Mommy! Momm-mmy!  He's gonna get me!
"
21,10,Bob White,"Honey, honey, who's gonna get you?
"
21,10,Crystal,"The President! I saw him! He's gonna get me!
"
21,10,Bob White,"Crystal, the President isn't going to get you.
"
21,10,Crystal,"But I saw him!
"
21,10,Bob White," See what I told you? It's that liberal school she's going to, filling her head with all kinds of garbage! Sweetie, the President is doing the best job he can. Your liberal school is just trying to convince you he's dangerous.
"
21,10,Crystal,"But Daddy, he's getting-
"
21,10,Bob White,"Uh uh, no buts! The President is in the White House, not here trying to get you. Okay?
"
21,10,Crystal,"Oh-kaaay?
"
21,10,Bob White,"All right.  We're having a talk with that school in the morning!  Good night, honey. 
"
21,10,Garrison,"Hey! How are my approval ratings?! 
"
21,10,Reporter,"And the latest reports are now saying that over a million Canadians were killed in the nuclear blast. The bomb dropped by the U.S. President took out the entire city of Toronto, and fallout is expected to kill thousands more in the coming days. 
"
21,10,Kyle,"Ike... Ike, I'm sorry that I caused a nuclear bomb to be dropped on Canada. I was just- you know, I was just trying to get shows that were toxic taken down. You know, those shows can be really harmful.
"
21,10,Ike,"Ohhh, stop being a victim! Jesus Christ! 
"
21,10,Bob White,"What I wanna know is, what gives you the right to preach your political views to my children?! Our daughter woke up with nightmares that the President was going to get her! Just because two liberals happen to be principal and vice principal doesn't mean you can brainwash my kids!
"
21,10,PC Principal,"Uh, we sort of have some bigger problems right now, Mr. Uh...
"
21,10,Bob White,"It's White. Bob White. You probably never even heard of our family, huh? Well, the Whites have been here since the beginning! Not that it matters, 'cause no one cares about the Whites. Sure, everyone else has problems, but does anyone ask the Whites how they're doing?!
"
21,10,Strong Woman,"Mr. White, we assure you that we run this school in a very  professional manner and don't let  personal emotions get in the way. 
"
21,10,Bob White,"Oh, sure you don't! You know how hard I had to fight to even get this meeting with you?! ""Oh, who wants to talk to the administration? Oh, it's just the Whites? Oh, who cares about the Whites? They're fine!"" Well, we've just about had with you, you understand?  And damn it, we won't be ignored!
"
21,10,Mrs. White," I'm sorry, is anyone else hearing ""(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don't Want To Be Right"" very very quietly?
"
21,10,Strong Woman," Uh, no. Mr. and Mrs. White, we promise that we will not let anything happen that might bring the integrity of this school into question.
"
21,10,Bob White,"Guess that's all the Whites can hope for these days.
"
21,10,Garrison,"Hey!
"
21,10,Tweek,"Aaaagh!
"
21,10,Garrison,"How are my approval ratings?
"
21,10,Tweek,"It's the President! Gaaahhh! 
"
21,10,Garrison,"Wait, come back! What's wrong?
"
21,10,Bill Keegan,"Still no word from the President, as his Splatty Tomato approval rating drops to an unprecedented 3%. This puts the President four points below Nut Job 2: Nutty By Nature. Meanwhile, the Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau called upon Canadians to stand strong.
"
21,10,Justin Trudeau," Make no mistake, America! If you do not hand over your President, there will be war the likes of which you have never seen! Canadians will rise together! I call on all Canadians here and abroad to stand with their country! The U.S. President must answer for his crime, and only Canada can bring him to justice! 
"
21,10,Craig," There there, Tweek. Everything is going to be okay.
"
21,10,Tweek,"I saw what I saw, Craig! You have to believe me!
"
21,10,Kyle," What's going on?
"
21,10,Craig,"Tweek's having a panic attack.
"
21,10,Tweek,"It was real! He tried to get me!
"
21,10,Kyle,"Who did?
"
21,10,Tweek,"The President! 
"
21,10,Craig,"It's just your imagination, Tweek.
"
21,10,Stan,"It's not his imagination. I saw him too.
"
21,10,Kyle,"You saw the President?
"
21,10,Stan,"Out by the quarry. But I didn't believe it. I said, ""How could this be...""
"
21,10,Heidi,"...""The President?""  I saw him too. He had a blue suit and an orange face. He kept asking me ""How are my ap...""
"
21,10,Tolkien,"""...How are my approval ratings?""  I saw him too.
"
21,10,Stan,"Dude, isn't this all really familiar? I saw something just like this on that show called Stranger...
"
21,10,Randy," ...Stranger Things. Stranger Things is the show. I saw it too.
"
21,10,Craig,"But wait, isn't Stranger Things just like that movie-?
"
21,10,Cartman,"Just like that movie It.
"
21,10,Randy,"You saw It too?
"
21,10,Cartman,"Yeah, I saw It in the theater.
"
21,10,Tolkien,"I saw Stranger Things AND It.
"
21,10,Randy,"Jesus. I don't think anyone's imagining anything. I think the President IS here. You kids get inside somewhere. I have to warn the town!  Aw!
"
21,10,Mayor McDaniels,"All right, people. People, please! We need everyone to try and stay calm.
"
21,10,Townsman 1,"How can we stay calm while the President's out there scaring our children?!
"
21,10,Mayor McDaniels,"Look, we all want the President out of here. It's just a matter of how we do it. I know you all want to get rid of him.
"
21,10,Bob White,"That's not true! The Whites still support the President
"
21,10,Randy,"Oh, for fuck's sake, White, he's running around eating our pets and terrorizing our kids!
"
21,10,Bob White,"You think Hillary would have been any better?!
"
21,10,Townsfolk,"Aw! Come on! Sit down, Bob!
"
21,10,Bob White," I'm just sayin', I'm just sayin'
"
21,10,Mayor McDaniels,"Listen, everyone. I have a team right now that's trying to locate the President, and I'd like you to hear from Officer Bright, who's leading the search. 
"
21,10,Officer Bright,"Hey folks, we know you're all uh concerned, but I wanna assure you that we're doing everything we can to track the President down and have him safely removed. Since the President was given a Splatty Tomato he's become very desperate and very dangerous. If you see the President, do not approach him. Do not try to reason with him. Most importantly, remember that this is the President, so you cannot shoot him. All right? You can't even talk about shooting him. Don't even... do any coy, satirical takes on shooting him.  Okay, good. What we're trying to do here is just get the President to go away. We're gonna be handing out padlocks like this one  so everyone can lock up their garbage. If we don't feed the President, hopefully he'll just move on. Are there any questions?
"
21,10,Townsman 2,"Can we talk about a friend shooting him if it's in sort of a sarcastic way?
"
21,10,Officer Bright,"No, no, no. It's just best to avoid that kind of talk altogether. Remember, they can do to you what they did to Kathy Griffin.
"
21,10,Randy,"Make her not funny for thirty years?
"
21,10,Officer Bright,"That's right, so best thing is just lock up your garbage and see if we can get the President to... go away.
"
21,10,Stan,"Jesus. Now kids are going missing.
"
21,10,Tweek,"We're all going to be missing soon! Nyaaarg!
"
21,10,Stan," Kyle! 
"
21,10,Kyle,"It's my fault. Ike went to go take matters into his own hands. I have to find him.
"
21,10,Craig,"We'll help you.
"
21,10,Stan,"We'll all help you.
"
21,10,Cartman,"Guys this could be very dangerous.
"
21,10,Heidi,"You're not going. You promised that tonight, we would have a date night.
"
21,10,Cartman,"Darling this is a little more pressing than date night.
"
21,10,Heidi,"Oh great. So Kyle's stupid brother goes missing, and I get fucked. How come I'm always the one getting shit on around here?
"
21,10,Kyle,"I don't need anyone to go with me.
"
21,10,Heidi,"Oh what's the matter, Kyle? Don't want me around because you had the hots for me and I shut you down?
"
21,10,Kyle,"I would never have the hots for the person you are now.
"
21,10,Stan,"Come on you guys. Look, we all know what we're supposed to do now We all saw ""It"" and ""Stranger Things"". We need to get our backpacks and go out to the woods and save the town from evil to some kick-ass '80s' music!
"
21,10,Waiter,"Hello, joining us for lunch today?
"
21,10,PC Principal,"Uh, yes. We are here with our student of the day to reward him lunch with the principal and vice principal.
"
21,10,Strong Woman,"We have a reservation.
"
21,10,Waiter,"Okay, last name?
"
21,10,Strong Woman,"Woman.
"
21,10,Waiter,"First name?
"
21,10,Strong Woman," Strong.
"
21,10,Waiter,"Oh, yes, Strong Woman, here we are. We have a nice booth set up for you.
"
21,10,Strong Woman,"We can't keep doing this. People are gonna see through it.
"
21,10,PC Principal,"Is it my fault that I found the most amazing, perfect, beautiful woman...at work?
"
21,10,Strong Woman,"Nobody will understand.
"
21,10,PC Principal,"Maybe they will. We're co-worker who are in love. You really think that's going to bother people?
"
21,10,Butters,"Well, should we order now?
"
21,10,Randy,"What are you doing, Bob?
"
21,10,Bob White,"Aah!
"
21,10,Randy," Have you been putting food out for the president?
"
21,10,Bob White,"No, I was just, uh, taking these sandwiches to the trash.
"
21,10,Randy,"We all agreed not to feed him so he'd go away.
"
21,10,Bob White,"We didn't all agree! You all agreed! Nobody asked the Whites how they felt! Nobody cares what the Whites have to say!
"
21,10,Randy,"Bob, come on. You have to know it's not safe to have him here.
"
21,10,Bob White,"In 2003, Hillary Clinton admitted to taking funds for her foundation from foreign diplomats!
"
21,10,Randy,"What's that got to do with anything, Bob? Come on.
"
21,10,Bob White,"It's fucking true!
"
21,10,Randy,"Bob, if Canada finds out the president is hiding here, they are going to nuke us. He needs to go.
"
21,10,Bob White,"Hillary wouldn't have been any better.
"
21,10,Randy,"Give me the finger sandwiches.
"
21,10,Bob White,"Fine! Go ahead and take the White's sandwiches! They've taken everything else!
"
21,10,Stan,"Due, this is '80's' music?
"
21,10,Craig,"Yeah. It's Pandora. '80s' channel.
"
21,10,Stan,"Well, just skip to the next song, man. We're trying to get psyched to destroy evil. We need better '80s' music than that.
"
21,10,Cartman,"Heidi? Honey, what are you doing?
"
21,10,Heidi,"This is the place... This is the place where I ended it all, remember? This is where I threw my phone of the bridge and quit Twitter for good.  I was so different then... so naive and hopeful. 
"
21,10,Cartman,"Yes honey, now can we get going, please?
"
21,10,Heidi,"I'm sorry! I'm trying to have a moment here! This is where our whole relationship started asshole!
"
21,10,Cartman,"Yes, it's very touching, sweetheart. I love you so much.  I'm sorry about this, you guys.
"
21,10,Heidi," I remember feeling like I had nobody. Skinny bitch.
"
21,10,Kyle,"We need to keep going guys.
"
21,10,Mayor McDaniels,"Don't tell me you haven't gotten the President out of here.
"
21,10,Officer Bright,"We haven't gotten the president out of here. And there's some worse news. A bunch of kids have gone missing.
"
21,10,Mayor McDaniels,"What?
"
21,10,Officer Bright,"I think we have to assume that the President has... eaten them. 
"
21,10,Mayor McDaniels,"Why are you here talking to me instead of trying to find the President?
"
21,10,Officer Bright,"Don't worry, we're close. He's out in the woods somewhere. And we've set up a fox trap.
"
21,10,Mayor McDaniels,"A fox trap?
"
21,10,Garrison,"Oh, Fox News... They'll listen to me. They'll get my side of the story right!
"
21,10,Bob White," It's a trap!
"
21,10,Garrison,"What?
"
21,10,Bob White,"It's a Fox trap, Mr. President!
"
21,10,Garrison,"Oh, thank God for the Whites.
"
21,10,Kyle,"Ike! Ike?
"
21,10,Stan,"Dude, come on! This is not kick-ass '80s' music!
"
21,10,Craig,"""Hold On to the Nights"" Richard Marx, 1988.
"
21,10,Tweek,"Do we really need music?
"
21,10,Stan,"Yeah! Craig just has the wrong stuff. Forget your pandora. I'm doing Spotify. '80s' music. 'Kay. There. 
"
21,10,Craig," Oh, yeah. That's better.
"
21,10,Kyle,"Can we go please?!
"
21,10,Kyle,"Here it is.  Ike?
"
21,10,Heidi,"Wait a minute... Isn't this the place you brought me before? The place you said your friends smashed your phone and computer...? I remember I felt so bad for you. We used to sit in the part and talk for hours. How come we never do that anymore?
"
21,10,Cartman,"Oh, fuck. Here we go.
"
21,10,Heidi,"Here we go what?! You used to be so nice to me.
"
21,10,Cartman,"You used to be nice to me!
"
21,10,Heidi,"I tried! But then you started rolling your eyes every time I tried to talk to you!
"
21,10,Cartman,"Ughhhh...
"
21,10,Kyle,"He's not here either.
"
21,10,Craig,"Dude, maybe your brother didn't even go looking for the President.
"
21,10,Kyle,"You don't understand Canadians. They're fiercely loyal to their country. When Canada is attacked, they all join in the fight.
"
21,10,Jimbo,"Randy! Randy!
"
21,10,Randy,"What?
"
21,10,Jimbo,"They got him! They found the President!
"
21,10,Officer Bright,"We found his hideout. There. Someone's gotta go flush him out. I'll be ready to trap him.
"
21,10,Randy,"I'll do it.
"
21,10,Officer Bright,"Hey, hey! Just remember he's been eating animals and living like a monster. Just... prepare yourself for what you're about to see.
"
21,10,Strong Woman,"Oh my God!
"
21,10,Randy,"What the... Principal and Vice Principal...?
"
21,10,Strong Woman,"I told you we couldn't hide.
"
21,10,Randy,"But... But you two work togeth... You two work togeth... 
"
21,10,Officer Bright,"Hey, what the hell's going on?!
"
21,10,Linda Black,"Who's together?
"
21,10,Randy,"The Principal and the Vice Principal!
"
21,10,Steven,"They can't be together! They're co-workers!
"
21,10,Offier Bright,"Wait, wait. You mean he's actually her superior and they were in there... 
"
21,10,Bob White,"Who would want to put their penis in a co-worker?! 
"
21,10,Kyle,"Oh, my God! Look! These are Ike's toy binoculars! He was here! Ike!
"
21,10,Heidi,"I remember this place too... This is where you brought me on Halloween. Remember?
"
21,10,Cartman," Yes, darling, wasn't it romantic?
"
21,10,Heidi,"No! It wasn't romantic. There was a witch and you had me dress up like Gretel and...  you were trying to get me killed!
"
21,10,Cartman,"Sweetheart, you made me late to the pumpkin patch, remember? I was hurt.
"
21,10,Heidi,"You were hurt! You Were the victim.
"
21,10,Cartman,"I'm glad you understand.
"
21,10,Heidi," Who turned you into this, Heidi? Shut up! Skinny-ass bitch! You don't know anything!
"
21,10,Cartman,"Heidi, I think spooky walk in the woods is making you lost it a little bit.
"
21,10,Stan,"Guys!
"
21,10,Garrison,"I'm seriously dehydrated and starving. I'm pretty sick of this shit, so you better... Aah!
"
21,10,Mr. Turner,"Have we already done a search of this area? Maybe she went there with her boyfriend!
"
21,10,Mrs. Turner,"She would have called by now.
"
21,10,Laura,"I just talked to the McCormicks. They haven't seen Tweek or Craig since yesterday.
"
21,10,Sharon,"Randy! Did you find anything?
"
21,10,Randy," Sharon... I... I...
"
21,10,Sharon,"What is it? What did you find?
"
21,10,Randy,"The... There's... Ugh...
"
21,10,Sharon,"Tell me! You have to tell me!  Oh, God! What did you see?!
"
21,10,Randy,"You don't want to know.
"
21,10,Sharon,"You have to tell me! I can take it! Did you find our son's arm? Did you find him torn apart? What?!
"
21,10,Randy,"The Principal and Vice Principal are, like... together.  Aw!
"
21,10,Officer Bright,"It's the President! 
"
21,10,Sheila,"Ike! Kyle!
"
21,10,Sharon,"Stan, you're okay!
"
21,10,Stan,"Yeah, we're okay!
"
21,10,Officer Bright,"We got him. We got the son of a bitch. 
"
21,10,Bob White,"Get back! Everyone back! Do it now! Get over here, family!
"
21,10,Randy,"Bob, for the love of Pete, our country is about to go to war!
"
21,10,Bob White,"You wanna know where there's a war?! There's a war on Christmas! Nobody cares about that! 'Cos guess who loves Christmas? The Whites! At least this man's trying to save Christmas!
"
21,10,Garrison," That's true!
"
21,10,Randy,"He's not saving Christmas, Bob. He's running around scaring your kids and shitting in the woods.
"
21,10,Bob White,"
"
21,10,Randy,"Come on, Bob. What's best for your daughter? I mean, really?
"
21,10,Heidi," You piece of shit! This was all your fault!  You controlled me and manipulated me and turned me into this!
"
21,10,Cartman,"Baby, put down the gun, sweetheart, okay?
"
21,10,Heidi,"I used to be kind. I used to be caring. But then you... you... No. Not you. Me. I did this. I let being a victim become a way of life. If you always make yourself the victim, you can justify being awful. Eric... I'm sorry. I'm breaking up with you.
"
21,10,Cartman,"Honey, don't be ridiculous.
"
21,10,Heidi,"I've been ridiculous. I have to learn to stop feeling sorry for myself.
"
21,10,Cartman,"Heidi, you are not breaking up with me.
"
21,10,Heidi,"Yes, I am. It's over.
"
21,10,Cartman,"I'm afraid I can't let you do that, sweetheart!  Step back! I'll do it I swear to God!
"
21,10,Heidi,"It's not gonna work this time, Eric.
"
21,10,Cartman,"You break up with me, I will kill myself! The choice is yours, Heidi! Come on everybody! ""Eric, we don't want you to die.""
"
21,10,Heidi,"I'm sorry. You can be the victim. I can't.
"
21,10,Cartman,"Heidi! Heidi, I'm gonna do it! Here we go! Heidi? Are you seriously...
"
21,10,Officer Bright,"He broke free!
"
21,10,Jimbo,"The President is on the loose again.
"
21,10,Officer Bright,"He'll be even more desperate now. It's going to get worse.
"
21,10,Stan,"We can't destroy him, can we?
"
21,10,Randy,"I don't know. I guess... It's up to the Whites.
"
