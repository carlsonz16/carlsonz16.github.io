23,1,Randy," Some people like their weed made the old-fashioned way.  Here at Tegridy, we believe weed is about people.  Over the past few months, Tegridy has expanded from the simple farmhouse you see behind me to actually owning the entire 420 Valley. And I think you'll see on this tour that even though our business has grown, we just kept our weed simple.  It takes over a thousand plants to make just one box of Tegridy Weed.  There's Juan Carlos over there; he's one of our newest employees.  'Mornin' Juan Carlos!  What happens when you combine science... with Tegridy? A lot of magic. Here you can see our latest growing methods along with our science center.  And of course, it wouldn't be Colorado weed without our Rocky Mountain High tasting room. Feel free to come back here later and try all our... Tegridy products.  Well, folks, we hope you enjoyed your tour. There's a lot to buy here in the gift shop and, please, do remember, your tour guides work on tips. Let's give me a big hand. 
"
23,1,Cartman,"This sucks balls. Ever since you guys moved, everything just keeps changing. I mean, how are all us kids supposed to have any hope anymore? All I think about is all the problems our generation is inheriting: climate change, overfishing, Kyle. I mean, how are we supposed to get happy about anything?  Hey there, Stan. You input all the weed orders?
"
23,1,Stan,"Yeah, it's all right here.
"
23,1,Randy,"Ah, hahah-uhl, oh.  Looks like our orders are actually... down. You sure you did that right?
"
23,1,Stan,"Yeah, I went through it twice. People aren't ordering as much as last month.
"
23,1,Randy,"Not ordering as much? Why... what the hell is going on?
"
23,1,Stephen,"Oh, hey, Randy.
"
23,1,Randy," Howdy, Stephen. How've you been gettin' on?
"
23,1,Stephen,"Good. How's life in the Valley been treatin' ya?
"
23,1,Randy,"Oh, it's early mornin's and lots of hard work, but, gotta do what's best for my young 'uns. I've noticed you haven't supplied up in a while, Stephen, so I thought I'd deliver your weed to you personally.
"
23,1,Stephen,"Oh... yeah, no , I... actually... hadn't ordered any in a while.
"
23,1,Randy,"Why not? You're not gettin' all sober on us, are ya?
"
23,1,Stephen,"No. Well... here, let me show you.  What do you think?  I started growing my own plants a couple of weeks ago. I totally get it. It's a really fun hobby. That's Diego, my gardener.
"
23,1,Randy,"Ohhh he, haha, hey... fuck you.
"
23,1,Stephen,"What?
"
23,1,Randy,"My weed not good enough for ya? Something wrong with Tegridy?
"
23,1,Stephen,"No, I just started kinda getting into it. I just enjoy the whole-
"
23,1,Randy,"You're stealing my idea Stephen!
"
23,1,Stephen,"Come on, growing marijuana is not your idea.
"
23,1,Randy,"Yeah-huh! While you assholes were all screwing around, I went out and made a living! When you grow your own pot, you're taking weed out of my children's mouths!
"
23,1,Mr. Mackey," Oh hey, guys. Sorry, the front door was open, so I just walked on in. Seein' if I could still get those seeds from ya, Stephen?
"
23,1,Randy," What seeds?!
"
23,1,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, I was gonna try my hand at growin' some weed and Stephen said he'd give me some seeds to get started.
"
23,1,Randy," FUUUCK YOU GUYS!  I'll get you for this, Stephen! You mess with my Tegridy, and I'm gonna mess with you! 
"
23,1,Clerk 1,"You alright there, partner?
"
23,1,Cartman,"Kids are being handed a world that's broken and sick. We aren't the ones who messed this planet up, but we're the ones who will pay the price.
"
23,1,Clerk 1,"Okay, you have a nice day. 
"
23,1,Diego,"¡Por favor no! ¡Por favor! Nomás quiero trabajar! 
"
23,1,Stephen,"This is inhumane! Diego is my gardener!
"
23,1,Cartman," What's going on?
"
23,1,Agent 1,"This is an ICE raid, son. You need to keep back.
"
23,1,Agent 2,"Put him in my car. 
"
23,1,Cartman,"What did that guy do?
"
23,1,Agent 1,"Somebody called in an anonymous tip that he might be here illegally.
"
23,1,Esposa,"¡No! ¡No te lo puedes llevar! ¡Es mi esposo! ¡Mi esposo!  
"
23,1,Girl,"Papa! Papa, no! Papa!
"
23,1,Agent 3,"Wife goes in the van, kids can go with Donovan. 
"
23,1,Stephen,"Who called you people?! It was Randy Marsh, wasn't it?!
"
23,1,Agent 1,"We're just doin' our job, sir. If the family checks out, we'll release them from their detention centers.
"
23,1,Cartman,"Detention centers?  Well, this is nice! When did we start doing this?
"
23,1,Agent 4," Kids go to LS22.
"
23,1,Cartman,"So anyone can make an anonymous tip and you can round up families and send them away? Nobody told me about this! I thought everything sucked now! Do you have a card?
"
23,1,Kyle,"What do you want?
"
23,1,Cartman,"Do you remember last week you called me a butthole in front of Suzie Tobler?
"
23,1,Kyle,"Yeah, 'cause you were gonna snap her bra.
"
23,1,Cartman,"I want you to apologize for every time you've been a dick to me, Kyle.
"
23,1,Kyle,"Fuck you.
"
23,1,Cartman,"Oh! Are you sure you don't want to take that back? Uh-okay Kyle. Just remember, I gave you a chance. 
"
23,1,Kyle,"Are you done now? Can I hang up? 
"
23,1,Agent 2,"220. We've breached the front door.
"
23,1,Kyle,"Hello?
"
23,1,Ike,"Mommy! Mommy!
"
23,1,Gerald," Excuse me, what is going on? 
"
23,1,Agent 5,"640. On the first floor. 
"
23,1,Sheila,"Who are you people?
"
23,1,Agent 3,"We're ICE, ma'am.
"
23,1,Gerald,"We're American citizens!
"
23,1,Agent 5,"Just doin' our job, sir. If you check out, you'll be released from the detention centers.
"
23,1,Gerald,"Get the fuck out of my house! 
"
23,1,Kyle,"Mom! Dad!
"
23,1,Gerald,"This is ridiculous! You can't take our children away from us!
"
23,1,Cartman," That's so sweet.
"
23,1,Agent 2,"You guys take the parents, we'll take the kids. 
"
23,1,Agent 1," Come on, you! 
"
23,1,Sheila,"NO! You will not take my children from me!
"
23,1,Cartman,"Ha ha. No way. 
"
23,1,Gerald,"I-I'm telling you, I just don't know where our passports are!
"
23,1,Agent 3,"Then we have to detain you. If you're legal, you can sort it all out on Monday.
"
23,1,Sheila,"Monday?! 
"
23,1,Kyle,"Goddamit, Cartman!
"
23,1,Sheila,"Ike!  YOU CAN'T DO THIS! 
"
23,1,Stan," What happened to our country? People are being wronged by a broken system, and we must say ""NO MORE."" No more homegrown marijuana.
"
23,1,Randy," Yeah, that's right! Yeah, that's right. Me too. Yeah, that's right!
"
23,1,Stan,"As the son of a proud American farmer, I am concerned about what homegrown can lead to. People can grow weed wrong and poison themselves. What?
"
23,1,Randy,"Yeah, that's right. Yeah! Come on!
"
23,1,Stan,"Unscrupulous growers could use cheap irrigation and drown babies. Oh, come on.
"
23,1,Randy,"That's right. Drown babies, yeah. Drown babies, that's right. Drown babies.
"
23,1,Stan,"The fact is simple. Marijuana must be grown with Tegridy.
"
23,1,Randy,"Tegridy.
"
23,1,Stan," Tegridy.
"
23,1,Randy," Stupid government! How can they sit there and look a child in the face and it's fine for people to grow their own weed?!
"
23,1,Towelie," Oh, why does it matter?
"
23,1,Randy,"Why does it? Ugh! Am I the only person here who understands what this will do to us?!
"
23,1,Stan,"Yeah, but Dad, you're gonna piss off everybody in South Park.
"
23,1,Randy,"You know what? Fuck South Park!
"
23,1,Towelie,"Fuck South Park?
"
23,1,Randy,"Yeah, I'm sick it! I'm just- I'm done! I don't give two shits about South Park! All that matters is Tegridy Farms now!
"
23,1,Towelie,"... I don't know if you wanna say ""Fuck South Park.""
"
23,1,Jeff,"Good day, children. My name is Jeff.
"
23,1,David,"Buenos días, niños. Me llamo Jefe. 
"
23,1,Jeff,"We know you've been separated from your families.
"
23,1,David,"Tu familia no está aquí, Es triste. Tu kri. Tu kri. 
"
23,1,Jeff,"But we want you to get a little excited about the fun we have in store for you.
"
23,1,David,"Aquí es mervilosa! Divértida!  
"
23,1,Jeff,"Everyone, please take your own piece of aluminum foil.
"
23,1,David,"Papél de aluminió, por favor.  
"
23,1,Rodgers,"All new kids, el nombre . Line up and announce when your name is read. Martinez!
"
23,1,Martinez,"Aquí. 
"
23,1,Rodgers,"Aguilar?
"
23,1,Aguilar,"Aquí. 
"
23,1,Rodgers,"Broflovski?
"
23,1,Kyle,"Here! 
"
23,1,David,"Broflovski - is, is that an El Salvadorean name?
"
23,1,Kyle,"No, I'm Jewish. 
"
23,1,Jeff,"What?! How did a Jew get in here?
"
23,1,Kyle,"I'm just here because some fat intolerant asshole didn't want me around!
"
23,1,Boy,"Yeah, that's why I'm here too.
"
23,1,Girl,"Yeah, me too.
"
23,1,Jeff,"Oh boy, we've gotta get this kid out of here.  People might think we're racist.
"
23,1,Randy,"Ah, sorry, tours at 11 and 2, and 4:20.
"
23,1,Bigwig 1,"Oh, we're not here for a tour, we represent a billion-dollar marijuana company.
"
23,1,Randy,"Ohh, I told you rich, big-city folk before: You can't buy Tegridy!
"
23,1,Bigwig 1,"You seem to be fighting the same fight we are. We just wanna help you.  Ever heard of Med Men?
"
23,1,Randy,"Yeah, I think so.  What do you want with me?
"
23,1,Bigwig 1,"Well, we have a common problem.  Homegrown weed.
"
23,1,Bigwig 2," We're just worried about safety, you know?  Babies drowning in irrigation and such.
"
23,1,Randy," Yeah, I hate watching babies drown.  Seems like a waste of a good baby. 
"
23,1,Bigwig 1,"We're glad you agree.  Now what-? 
"
23,1,Randy,"So you guys wanna team up and piggyback on the goodwill of the legalization movement for some good old-fashioned crony capitalism? I'm totally in. 
"
23,1,Jeff,"Sorry for our little mistake. We're goin' to get you on your way home as soon as we can.
"
23,1,Kyle,"What about all the other kids? When do they get to go home?
"
23,1,Jeff,"Hey. When it's raining, you gotta roll up the windows. We understand these things are hard for your people.
"
23,1,Kyle,"My people? Aren't you worried about what you're creating here?!
"
23,1,Jeff,"What do you mean?
"
23,1,Kyle,"You're pulling children away from their parents and isolating them behind bars.
"
23,1,Jeff,"Yes.
"
23,1,Kyle,"You're traumatizing them and teaching them to fear the U.S. government.
"
23,1,Jeff,"Correct.
"
23,1,Kyle,"Okay, let me try to put this in terms you people will understand. You know superhero movies, right?
"
23,1,David," Yeah!
"
23,1,Kyle,"Okay. You remember how they always create the villain? Some random person who, when they were a child, got taken from their parents and locked away? And the kid was just left to sit and plot revenge? What you're doing here is creating a Mexican Joker!  And what's a Mexican Joker gonna do? He's gonna grow up and have memories of being wronged by you, and he will grow and wait, and then finally  fight back with a passion unlike anything you've ever seen!
"
23,1,Jeff,"Which one of them do you think is Mexican Joker?
"
23,1,Kyle,"No, it could be any of them! That's the point! You don't know which kid in there is gonna snap from being separated and locked down like this!
"
23,1,David,"But... Doesn't Mexican Joker understand that we're just doing our job and making America great?
"
23,1,Kyle,"Mexican Joker doesn't care! When that kid grows up, all that will matter is getting back at all of you!
"
23,1,David,"Well, what would Mexican Joker-
"
23,1,Jeff,"Hey David, can I talk to you alone, please. Excuse us, kid.  Now then, the most important thing is that we've got to keep this quiet! We can't let Mexican Joker know that we're onto him.
"
23,1,David,"I don't wanna be part of a bad guy flashback scene. Maybe we should get kids out of here.
"
23,1,Jeff,"Now, listen: that's just what he wants us to do.
"
23,1,David,"What are you saying?
"
23,1,Jeff,"Im saying, what if he's on Mexican Joker's side? 
"
23,1,Towelie," Hey Randy, did you go make a deal with another weed company?
"
23,1,Randy,"Yes, Towelie. I'm working on a merger with Med Men.
"
23,1,Towelie,"Med Men? But, those guys are posers.
"
23,1,Randy,"We have a deal in the works to help each other put a stop to home-growers once and for all.
"
23,1,Towelie,"Jesus... You know, I knew a guy who thought weed should be for everybody. A guy who believed in integrity. I don't understand who you even are anymore.
"
23,1,Randy,"That's because I'm the president of the company, and YOU are a TOWEL!
"
23,1,Towelie,"YOU're a towel!
"
23,1,Randy,"What is wrong with trying to protect our business? 
"
23,1,Towelie," Because weed isn't supposed to be some money-grubbin' business model! It's a gift from God! And not something to exploited by some stupid towel! 
"
23,1,Randy,"I AM NOT A TOWEL!
"
23,1,Towelie," Yeah. Yeah, sure thing, Randy. You are not a towel. 
"
23,1,Princess Star,"My name is Princess Star, for I shine like all the stars in the night sky.
"
23,1,Jeff,"Kids, let's all say hi to Princess Star!
"
23,1,David,"Hi, Princess Star.
"
23,1,Mexican Joker,"Ha ha ha haa! It's me, Mexican Jokerrrrr!
"
23,1,Jeff,"Oh no! Everyone boo Mexican Joker, kids! Boooo!
"
23,1,David,"Boooo!
"
23,1,Mexican Joker,"I'm filled with anger and rage for what happened to me as a child! So now I will kill and rape you all!
"
23,1,Princess Star,"But Mexican Joker, you forget the magic word: Forgiveness. 
"
23,1,Mexican Joker,"I don't care about forgiveness!
"
23,1,Princess Star,"But you are a migrant from another country. We had to protect our borders and secure our jobs.
"
23,1,Mexican Joker,"I don't care! I'm going to rape you now! 
"
23,1,Princess Star,"Oh no, no, what about forgiveness?
"
23,1,Mexican Joker,"No forgiveness! 
"
23,1,Jeff,"Boo! That's enough, Mexican Joker! Your rage and your anger have made you a bad person in the eyes of Christ. I know your life was hard as a kid, but everyone has hard times. 
"
23,1,Agent 6,"Another busload comin' in.
"
23,1,Jeff," Another busload? Oh, criminy!
"
23,1,Jeff,"Welcome, children. My name is Jeff.
"
23,1,David,"Hola niños, me llamo Jefe...  
"
23,1,Cartman,"Oh, hey Kyle.
"
23,1,Kyle,"What the fuck are you doing here?!
"
23,1,Cartman,"So weak. Jimmy pissed me off 'cause he told the teacher I was texting in class, so I told Jimmy I'd have him sent off to a migrant detention center. He didn't believe me, so I said ""Oh, I already did it to Kyle."" Stan heard that, so he got pissed off and had me sent off to a migrant detention center.
"
23,1,Kyle,"I haven't seen my parents in *two weeks*! Nobody even knows where my little brother is!
"
23,1,Cartman,"I know. I know it sucks. But we're stuck in here together. Come on, buys. All we have to do is try to make the most of it. It's a hard knock life for us.It's a hard knock life for us.
"
23,1,Clerk 2,"Hey, are you gonna buy a towel or just stare at them?
"
23,1,Randy,"I'm not a towel!
"
23,1,Clerk 2,"Go on! Get out of here! 
"
23,1,Mr. Mackey,"Yeah, you know, I think I'll just grow my own weed.
"
23,1,Stephen,"Oh yeah, I'm growin' my own weed.
"
23,1,Jimbo,"I enjoy growin' my own weed now.
"
23,1,Stephen,"I'll grow my own weed.
"
23,1,Jimbo,"My own weed.
"
23,1,Mr. Mackey,"My own weed. I'll grow my own weed.
"
23,1,Jimbo,"I enjoy growin' my own weed.
"
23,1,Stephen,"Hey, I think I'll just grow my own weed. 
"
23,1,Clerk 2," I said get out of here if you aren't buying towels! 
"
23,1,Stephen,"I'll grow my own weed.
"
23,1,Jimbo,"My own weed.
"
23,1,Stephen,"My own weed. I'll grow my own weed.
"
23,1,Jimbo,"I'll grow my own weed.
"
23,1,Stephen,"I'll grow my own weed.
"
23,1,Randy," Aaaaaaaaaaah!  Ah. Augh! Aaaaawwww!!
"
23,1,Jeff,"Hey. Hey! What the hell are you guys doin'?!
"
23,1,David,"Oh, hey Jeff. Rodgers read an article about how electroshock therapy can help people who've gone through traumatic experiences. We figured some treatments could help Mexican Joker deal with his trauma.
"
23,1,Jeff,"Are you guys completely stupid?! We can't perform shock therapy on every child that comes in here! Think of the budgetary restraints!
"
23,1,David,"To hell with the costs, Jeff! If Mexican Joker doesn't have flashbacks, then he doesn't grow up to be a monster!
"
23,1,Jeff,"What if this IS the flashback?! We might be IN the flashback, Dave! Maybe you're shocking the child that grows up to be Mexican Joker! 
"
23,1,David," Oh God! I don't know which way is up anymore!
"
23,1,Jeff,"We can't fight this guy alone, Dave. It's time to alert the military.
"
23,1,Cartman,"Don't it feel like the wind is always howlin'? Don't it seem like there's never any light? Santa never comes for me. Santa Claus no está aquí.   Aw, come on, Kyle. I know it's no fun to be in here, but you can't think about yourself. Think about the greater good.  Now, when you don't like people, you can have then taken from their families and put into camps. Why does that make you  Ohhh my God. Ohhh Jesus, Kyle. I've totally forgotten you're a... Of course, you're extra sensitive to this stuff. Oh, dude, I'm so sorry.  Oh, my God, Kyle. I didn't even make the connection, you know? I was just like, Oh, I'm gonna have Kyle thrown into a detention camp. That'll be sweet,"" and I didn't stop to think that... for you guys... it's not that sweet. Man, if I had just thought it through for like, two more minutes, I would have got you back some other way. I feel terrible, Kyle.
"
23,1,Kyle,"Wait. I have an idea how to get everyone out of here. Get everyone's aluminum foil and some scissors.
"
23,1,Cartman,"Why, Kyle? What are you gonna do with-
"
23,1,Kyle,"Just do it before I kill you!
"
23,1,Cartman,"Aluminum foil and some scissors. 
"
23,1,Husband,"That was a great dinner, honey.
"
23,1,Wife,"What do you wanna do for dessert?
"
23,1,Husband,"Hey! How about I cut us down some of our homegrown weed and we get baked?
"
23,1,Wife,"I'm in. 
"
23,1,Husband,"Is someone there?  Huh. 
"
23,1,Wife,"Jack? Everything alright?
"
23,1,Jack,"Yeah. You want a normal size, or a big fatty?  Aa-
"
23,1,Wife,"JAACK! 
"
23,1,News Anchor,"A brutal act of terror in an American town. Tonight, innocent people were attacked at their homes, in their yards, and the FBI believes they know who is responsible. The probable suspect?  Mexican Joker.  Uhuh. Yeah, that's right. Joining me now is Commander Miller of National Defense.
"
23,1,Cmdr Miller,"We've only recently learned of Mexican Joker's existence.
"
23,1,News Anchor,"Waa huhaugh.
"
23,1,Cmdr Miller,"He has no reason. He has no compassion.
"
23,1,News Anchor,"Aaagh.
"
23,1,Cmdr Miller,"Mexican Joker simply wants to invoke fear.
"
23,1,News Anchor,"Oohh!
"
23,1,Cmdr Miller,"We are advising people to stay inside!
"
23,1,News Anchor,"Uh, look. Captain, uh... Captain, what made Mexican Joker this way? Why is Mexican Joker so... filled with hate?
"
23,1,Cmdr Miller,"Well, it's most likely something that happened to him as a child. Whatever bent Mexican Joker's mind this way, it clearly happened a... long... a long time ago. 
"
23,1,Jeff,"Oh shit, it's the flashback!
"
23,1,David,"This is the flashback?!
"
23,1,Jeff,"It's the flashback! Come on! Something must be happening with the kids!  Oh Christ, look!
"
23,1,Kyle,"Shema Israel Adonai Eloheinu, Adonai ehad. 
"
23,1,Jeff,"He's converting them all to Judaism!
"
23,1,Kids,"Shema Israel Adonai Eloheinu, Adonai ehad. 
"
23,1,Jeff,"Oh Jesus, they're all Jews with their little aluminum foil yarmulkes!
"
23,1,David,"Jeff, you know what this means? Now we'll have to let them all go! This is how Mexican Joker breaks free!
"
23,1,Jeff,"Hey, that's right. It is. 
"
23,1,Cartman,"Whoa!
"
23,1,Jeff," Mexican Joker, I just want you to remember that I helped you. Jeff Corrigan. Remember, Jeff was your buddy. Now, come on! Let's go, Mexican Joker! 
"
23,1,Kyle,"Goddamnit, nobody here is Mexican Joker! That's not what I meant! The future is not set! We make decisions now that affect our future!
"
23,1,Jeff,"Nobody here is Mexican Joker?
"
23,1,Kyle,"NO!!
"
23,1,Jeff,"Oh, then I'm in the wrong flashback. 
"
23,1,Randy,"Well, gang. Looks like Tegridy Farms are turning big profits again. We're on our way to becoming the biggest weed brand in the country. I'm not getting pushed around now, you got it? So go on. Anybody here wants to call me a towel, just go ahead and do it! Go on, Sharon. Call me a towel.
"
23,1,Sharon,"Fine. You're a towel. 
"
23,1,Randy,"Best towel you ever had, bitch!
"
23,2,Randy," Stan! Family meeting! Get downstairs! 
"
23,2,Stan,"I'm writing a song, Dad.
"
23,2,Randy," Nobody cares about that! Come on! I've got big news!  Sharon! Shelly! Hurry! I've got it! 
"
23,2,Sharon,"What is it, Randy?
"
23,2,Randy,"You guys, I've just had the greatest idea ever!
"
23,2,Stan,"We're gonna move back to our old house?
"
23,2,Randy,"No! I've been trying to figure out how to make more money selling weed. And last night, it came to me. We could grow the family business by selling Tegridy... to the Chinese.  I did a little research. Turns out there's a lot of people in China. If we can get like 2% of that market to buy our weed, we'd make millions and millions of dollars! I'm flying to China tomorrow. I've got to get in on this before anyone else thinks of it. 
"
23,2,Sharon,"Tomorrow? Ugh!  Randy, are you forgetting about this Saturday?
"
23,2,Randy,"What's this Saturday?
"
23,2,Sharon,"Autumnfest? Stan's concert? He and his little friends have been rehearsing all week. A lot of people in town are coming out to support him. Everyone but you?
"
23,2,Randy,"Everyone?  Stan, you need to wear your Tegridy T-shirt at the performance.
"
23,2,Stan,"Aw, come on, Dad!
"
23,2,Randy,"Stan, they're available on Amazon starting Friday, so you could really help promote the family business while I'm gone!  But, then again, I guess family doesn't mean all that much to you. 
"
23,2,Kate & Earl,"
Tumbleweeds and squirrels, my darlin'. 
Tumbleweeds and squirrels.

23,2,Kate,"Yeah.
"
23,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Okay, that was the South Park Soundaroos! Thanks again to Kate and Earl! Alright, up next we have four of our local South Park fourth graders who have formed a band. Let's hear it for Stan Marsh and Crimson Dawn. 
"
23,2,Sharon,"Hi, Stanley! 
"
23,2,Stephen,"Hoh, there's our Butters.
"
23,2,Linda," Oh, Butters! Oh, aren't they cute?
"
23,2,Stan," Um, hi. We're Crimson Dawn, and um, this is a song I wrote about living out in the country, on a farm.
"
23,2,Jimmy,"Alright, f-f-f-fellas, just like we rehearsed it. And-a 1, and-a 2, and -a 
"
23,2,Stan,"

Fate is over! 
Open your eyes!


"
23,2,Butters,"
Get me off this farm!


"
23,2,Stan,"
There is no hope, no second chance! 
All the elders saw the fall of the sky! 
Pride and glory! 
To touch the sky, we've burned the earth! 
Built our own infirmity!


"
23,2,Randy,"First time goin' to China?
"
23,2,Passenger 1,"Uhn, no, not really.
"
23,2,Randy," It's my first time. I'm goin' out to try and drum up a little ""business."" What are you headin' out for?
"
23,2,Passenger 1,"Uh, I work for a clothing company. We're trying to break into the market and get the Chinese people as customers.
"
23,2,Randy,"Ohhh, huhuh, heeeyy. Fuck you.
"
23,2,Passenger 1,"Huh?
"
23,2,Randy,"I, I had that idea like three days ago.
"
23,2,Passenger 1,"So what?
"
23,2,Randy,"So when did you come up with it? 
"
23,2,Passenger 2,"Hehey, Mitchell, you're on this flight?
"
23,2,Mitchell,"Yeah, that's so funny! I'm working for Google now, overseeing the expansions into the Chinese user base.
"
23,2,Passenger 2,"Heh, yeah, I'm still with the NBA doing some press with the players to try to... get more Chinese viewers.
"
23,2,Randy," Oh, for Christ's sake! You have a good idea and everyone wants to copy you! Fine! I can handle some healthy competition! Who else wants to go to China and get some of their money?!  Oh, for cryin' out loud!  Let me guess. You work for a company trying to get Chinese people as customers. ""Wow, where'd you get that idea?""  It's okay, it's okay. I'm sure there's plenty of Chinese people for all of us.
"
23,2,Stan (Butters),"

Searching, wandering
Looking for the perfect specimen.
Still pure. (Hate this farm!) 
Immature. (I hate this farm!)
Acknowledged sickness
concealed, swaggering!
Unseen (Hate this farm!)
Wandering (I hate this farm!)
Looking for the perfect specimen.


 Okay, okay. Wait uh, hang on, guys. 

"
23,2,Producer," Very good, boys!  I hear you guys play at Autumnfest. I really like your sound.
"
23,2,Butters,"Who are you?
"
23,2,Producer,"Well I'm a producer. I manage all the big rock bands in South Park. PC Babies... All of them!.
"
23,2,Jimmy,"You manage the PC Babies? Holy smokes, fellas, they're huge!
"
23,2,Stan,"You wanna sign us so we can make a record and I can move away from here?
"
23,2,Producer,"Records? What, are you, kids, from the '90s!? There's no money in albums or singles or even tours anymore. What we need to focus on... is your biopic.
"
23,2,Stan,"Biopic? You want to make the Crimson Dawn Biopic?
"
23,2,Producer,"PC Babies' biopic came out last week. Made over $100 million!
"
23,2,Butters,"Wow wee!
"
23,2,Kenny,"(What do ya think, Stan?)
"
23,2,Producer,"Well I'll just let you guys think on it, but don't take too long, huh?
"
23,2,Female Inspector,"谢谢。下一位。
"
23,2,Randy," Hello. Howdy.  I'm a small business owner from the United States. You guys know any money people here?  Can I give you guys my card? I'm just starting to grow my business here in China. 
"
23,2,Male Inspector,"等一下，你看看这个。
"
23,2,Female Inspector,"What is this, sir?
"
23,2,Randy,"Oh that? That's weed. Marijuana. You know. 
"
23,2,Female Inspector,"保安，保安！赶紧过来！
"
23,2,Randy,"Ah, here. Here we go. Jay shi daamaa Tegridy Weed.  Whoa! Oh hey! Everything alright? What's going on?  Uh hey, don-don't forget my suitcase! C-could you grab my suitcase? All my weed is in there! Excuse me! Jay shi daamaa!
"
23,2,Producer,"What makes a band truly great? It's the desire to be heard, and a commitment to a three-act structure that has a 20-minute setup, about an hour and a half of conflict, and a big, triumphant resolution. SO, let's start at the beginning, gang. When did your band first form?
"
23,2,Stan,"Uuummm, it was about two weeks ago.
"
23,2,Butters,"Yeah. As a matter of fact, two and a half, three weeks ago, I'd say.
"
23,2,Stan,"I hah, I hah, I hadn't seen my friend Kyle, and I hate living on a farm, so I started writing songs.
"
23,2,Producer,"That's good, that's good.  ""Lost a close friend. Put loneliness into lyrics.""
"
23,2,Butters,"Yeah, and then Stan came to me, and then I said ""Well I can play the drums.""
"
23,2,Jimmy,"But he already asked me to play the drums
"
23,2,Butters,"Well, so yeah, I, okay, I'll play guitar.
"
23,2,Producer," ""Inner conflict over direction of band."" Good.
"
23,2,Stan,"Oh. And then Kenny learned to play bass watching YouTube videos of John Lennon with the Dalai Lama.
"
23,2,Producer,"Oh no oh OH oh yeah, no no, we don't wanna go there. Talking about the Dalai Lama doesn't go over well with the Chinese.
"
23,2,Jimmy,"The the the what?
"
23,2,Producer,"Look, for this movie to really make money, we need to make sure it clears the Chinese censors, you know. We want those Chinese viewers..
"
23,2,Stan," Aw, seriously?
"
23,2,Producer,"Oh it's okay, there's plenty of other things to talk about with your story. How about, uh, what kind of things were you into when you were younger?
"
23,2,Butters,"Well, I always liked Winnie the Pooh.
"
23,2,Producer,"Okay-oh no. Nonono, that's definitely off-limits. Winnie the Pooh is illegal in China because some Chinese students said that he looked like the Chinese president,
"
23,2,Stan,"Oh, come on. That's ridiculous!
"
23,2,Producer,"Hey, you wanna move away from your family, right? You wanna be successful on your own, right?
"
23,2,Stan," Yeah.
"
23,2,Producer,"All right. Well, you know what they say you gotta lower your ideals of freedom if you wanna suck on the warm teat of China.
"
23,2,Randy,"Aaaugh. I am a proud member of the Communist Party, The Party is more important than the individual. 
"
23,2,Prisoner 1,"不要！求求你放过我吧！不要，不要，求求你... 
"
23,2,A familiar voice,"Oh, hello there.
"
23,2,Randy," Who, who's there?
"
23,2,Winnie the Pooh,"Nobody. Just a bear.  I was wondering since you're new if you might have... some honey?
"
23,2,Randy,"No, I don't have any honey. Are you prisoners here?
"
23,2,Piglet,"Some people said Pooh looked like the Chinese p-p-p-president, so we're illegal in China now.
"
23,2,Randy,"Jesus. What kind of madhouse is this?
"
23,2,Prisoner 2,"我求你原谅我。我是个很烂的人。我再也不会取笑共产党了。
"
23,2,Presiding Judge,"你为你的国家和家人为耻。再补上十年！
"
23,2,Prisoner 2,"不要！我求你不要！我不能再回去了，我不能再回去！
"
23,2,Presiding Judge,"快把下一位带进来！
"
23,2,Randy,"Your Honors, I'm just a simple farmer, from a simpler time. Now, I've never been to China before, but I hate to say I'm a little disappointed in all of you. From what I've seen, you seem to treat your people like dirt. You don't believe in any individual freedoms. I mean, you got Winnie the Pooh and Piglet in jail! Now, come on, China! You know, a country ain't nothin' unless it's got decency and in-tegrity! And I think I speak for Pooh and Piglet and all of Disney when I say you could use some 'tegrity, China!  Now, it just so happens that I own a Tegridy farm. And I think I might be able to work out a deal for all you nice folk.
"
23,2,Stan,"This is so awesome, you guys. Our band is gonna be huge.
"
23,2,Butters,"Yeah. And, we're gonna be rich.
"
23,2,Kenny,"(They're the same thing.)
"
23,2,Jimmy," Yeah. Isn't this just great?
"
23,2,Stan,"Hey. What's wrong, Jimmy?
"
23,2,Jimmy,"Fella, I need to tell you something. I think I'm homosexual. And also, I'm addicted to cocaine.
"
23,2,Butters,"Oh, that's okay, Jimmy.
"
23,2,Stan,"Yeah, we can get you a liver transplant.
"
23,2,Producer,"Cut! Cut! Listen, guys, we uh just got word back from the Chinese censors. They don't want us mentioning organ transplants.
"
23,2,Stan,"How come?
"
23,2,Producer,"Well, they've been accused of harvesting from the-look look, it doesn't matter. They, they just said ""no"" to the organ stuff. Oh, and uhh, no homosexuality either.
"
23,2,Stan,"No homosexuality?! We're trying to do a band biopic!
"
23,2,Butters,"Yeah! And what's wrong with homosexuality anyway?!
"
23,2,Producer,"Nothing. Unless you wanna make money in China. Now come on! Everyone back to one!
"
23,2,Mickey Mouse," All right?! Who's the asshole?! Which one of you decided to go and start badmouthing the Chinese government?! Haha. Who here thought they had permission to say anything critical of Chinese politics?!
"
23,2,Thor,"Well, it is true, sir. The Chinese seem to exploit their own people in forced labor cam-
"
23,2,Mickey,"SHUT THE FUCK UP, THOR! You're here to flex and not speak, you fucking bitch!
"
23,2,Pooh,"Please, Mr. Marsh was only standing up for me and Piglet because we were political prisoners.
"
23,2,Mickey,"YOU are a fat diabetic bear, and if the Chinese don't want you, then I don't either! Now, who the fuck is Mr. Marsh?!
"
23,2,Randy,"Uhhh, that's me. Randy Marsh
"
23,2,Mickey,"Who is this?! I don't know you?! Are you from Pixar?!
"
23,2,Randy,"No, I'm from South Park.
"
23,2,Mickey,"What's South Park? Do I own that?!
"
23,2,Off-Screen Assistant,"No, not yet sir.
"
23,2,Mickey,"You're telling me, haha, that I'm losing Chinese customers because of some shithead that's not even from MY company?!
"
23,2,Randy,"Hey, hold on a minute! Do you really think this business should be run through intimidation and fear?! Whatever happened to old-time values?! You already have business with the Chinese. You have all the connections money can buy! But there's one thing you don't have. That's Tegridy. Now, it just so happens-
"
23,2,Mr. Mackey,"Boys, I understand you have a band at the school?
"
23,2,Stan,"Yeah. what's wrong with that?
"
23,2,Mr. Mackey,"Well, boys, it seems to me like your music is kind of... angry. M'kay? I mean, it's really loud, m'kay, and it's a little angry.
"
23,2,Stan,"Yeah, because I hate living on a farm 30 miles out of town!
"
23,2,Jimmy,"Yeah, tell him, Stan!
"
23,2,Stan,"I can't stand my dad anymore, and if I want to do death metal, I can! It's a free country!
"
23,2,Producer,"Cut! Cut! Cut, cut.  Ah kids, let's not say anything about this being a free country.
"
23,2,Stan,"Aw, come on!
"
23,2,Producer,"Hey! These guys were nice enough to come all the way from China to help us with our standards. We can at least listen to their notes.  Oh. Oka-okay. Okay.  Actually gang, we need to rewrite the whole second act.
"
23,2,Stan,"But that will take forever!
"
23,2,Producer,"Come on, guys! Everyone else is fine with China approving our entertainment. Even the PC Babies don't seem to mind, and PC Babies cry about everything.  They just gotta rewrite the script before we continue shooting. Go back to your room and just write your story. It has to come from your heart.
"
23,2,Mickey,"It's like, it's like they didn't even wanna listen.
"
23,2,Randy,"They didn't listen at all? But I... wuh-why not?
"
23,2,Mickey,"It's the bear. They're still pissed off about the bear.
"
23,2,Randy,"But for what?
"
23,2,Mickey,"'Cause some Chinese people on the Internet starting posting pictures of their President as Winnie the Pooh. It's a real thing. Look it up.  Man, this is really good shit.
"
23,2,Randy,"What if we took their side, then? What if we showed China that we understand how they feel to be made fun of on the Internet?
"
23,2,Censor,"嗯？这是什么？！你给中国人丢脸啊！ 
"
23,2,Stan,"Now I know how all the writers in Hollywood feel. 
"
23,2,Censor,"嗯？这是什么？！
"
23,2,Piglet,"My Goodness, Pooh. China sure is a big p-p-p-p-place.
"
23,2,Pooh,"Yes, Piglet. It is. Too big, I think, to find what I need.  Excuse me.
"
23,2,Merchant,"Huh?
"
23,2,Pooh,"Would you happen to have... some honey?
"
23,2,Merchant,"啊！我不要麻烦！我不要麻烦！走！
"
23,2,Pooh,"Oh bother. This just doesn't seem to be the place... for a bear.
"
23,2,Piglet," Wait. Pooh. Loo-l-l-look, look. 
"
23,2,Pooh,"Ooo, Piglet! What wonderful luck!  What delicious honey! Mmm. I would like to share, Piglet. Perhaps... I will share. In just a few more slurps, I can. 
"
23,2,Piglet," W-W-What are you do--Wha--No! Ohh! 
"
23,2,Stan,"I can't do it anymore, you guys. I can't even think with the Chinese government censoring everything I write.
"
23,2,Butters,"So there's not gonna be a biopic movie for us?
"
23,2,Stan,"It's so wrong. You know, I mean, we live in a time when the only movies us American kids go see are ones that are approved by China.
"
23,2,Jimmy,"Yeah. It' like China is the new MPAA.
"
23,2,Butters,"Stinks to say goodbye to all that biopic money and glory.
"
23,2,Stan,"We just gotta face it. A death metal band is never gonna make real money anymore. The only band that would get approved by China would be all vanilla and cheesy.  I'm gonna have to live on that fucking farm forever. 
"
23,2,Stan," Kyle! Dude, you're back! 
"
23,2,Cartman,"Yeah, the migrant detention camp was kewl, but it kinda rubs Kyle the wrong way. 
"
23,2,Kyle,"Anything happen while we were gone?
"
23,2,Stan,"Not really. We just almost had a biopic made for our band, but ...wait a minute...  Wait, vanilla and cheesy! I've got it. I've got it!
"
23,2,Fingerbang,"
Fingerbang-bang!
Bang bang.
Fingerbang-bang!
Bangbangbang.
I'm gonna fingerbang-bang you into my life
Girl, you like to fingerbang, and it's alright.
'Cause I'm the king of fingerbang; let's not fight
I'm goin' tuh fingerbang-bang-


"
23,2,Stan,"Cut. Cut, cut!  This is all wrong.
"
23,2,Producer,"No, it's good, kids! They're loving it!
"
23,2,Stan,"Yeah, but I can't sell my soul like this. I want to get away from that farm, more than anything, but it's not worth living in a world where China controls my country's art.  I don't care how many people you have! I've got something in me that just won't let me be a part of all this.
"
23,2,Butters,"Yeah! Whatever it is, I got it too!
"
23,2,The others,"Yeah!
"
23,2,Stan,"I wanna be proud of who we are, guys! And anybody who would betray their ideals just to make money in China isn't worth a lick of spit!
"
23,2,Narrator,"Us Chinese people have always liked things the old fashioned way. We like things a little simpler, a little quieter. And now, there's a new weed that goes along with China's beating heart. Because after a hard day of forced labor, or getting beaten for criticizing the government, we all could use a little time with some good ol'... It's the soul of the American West, right here in mother China. All hail the Communist Party, and all hail Tegridy weed.
"
23,2,Randy,"Well, gang, looks like the family business is starting to really turn the corner. I don't know about you, but I, for one, think the world is gonna be a better, and safer, place, now that China finally has Tegridy.
"
23,2,Stan," Dad, why are you covered in honey and blood?  Dad? Did you kill Winnie the Pooh?
"
23,2,Randy,"Winnie the Pooh, Winnie the Pooh- Oh, yeah, I did kill Winnie the Pooh.  Where are ya goin', Stan?
"
23,2,Stan,"I'm going to go write another song about you.
"
23,2,Randy,"Ooo, about me? Make sure it talks about me bringing Tegridy to China!
"
23,3,Randy,"
Happy 300 to us.
Happy 300 to us.
Happy 300, Tegridy Farms.


"
23,3,"Sharon, Stan, Shelley"," Ugh!
"
23,3,Randy,"
Happy $300,000.

 Can you believe it, gang? We've broken $300,000 selling weed.  Not to be a dick, but I remember when you, Sharon, and you, Shelley, said buying a pot farm was a  ""stupid"" idea. Now we're living the dream.
"
23,3,Shelley,"You're living the dream. This is your dream!
"
23,3,Randy," You know,  is it me, or are people starting to not be that stoked on Tegridy Farms?  Are you guys still pissed off about the China thing?  You may not like that I do business with China , but personally, I think you guys having a problem with China is racist. Now come on! Let's celebrate 300!  Who wants shots?!
"
23,3,Sharon,"Shots?!
"
23,3,Cartman,"No shots! No shots!
"
23,3,Liane,"Eric, you have to be a big boy.
"
23,3,Doctor," Big boys get a toy from the toy chest.
"
23,3,Cartman," No! No! No! No! No! 
"
23,3,Doctor," Eric, it's just a little prick.
"
23,3,Cartman," No! No! No! Noooooo!
"
23,3,Liane,"Good boy, Eric! 
"
23,3,PC Principal,"Our school now has a very strict policy when it comes to immunizations. Everyone has to follow the protocol, or it puts everyone at risk.
"
23,3,Liane,"I'm sorry, PC Principal. It's just that my little Eric really doesn't like shots.
"
23,3,PC Principal,"Well, Eric, nobody likes shots. They're just a fact of life.
"
23,3,Liane,"No no, you don't understand. I-I've taken him to the doctor every Friday for the past 4 years. They try to give him his shot, but he gets scared and runs around. and he squeals like a little pig. The doctors try to catch him, but Eric greases himself up so they can't.
"
23,3,PC Principal,"I'm sorry, but my hands are tied here. If Eric isn't immunized, then he cannot go to this school.
"
23,3,Liane," Please! I've tried everything! You have to let Eric go to school! I work all day, and without school, he'll just... he'll just have nothing!
"
23,3,PC Principal,"What do you think's gonna be different next time you try?
"
23,3,Liane,"Ih- if you could offer Eric something. Uhm, sometimes when Eric behaves this way, I think of a gift or a treat of some kind.
"
23,3,Cartman,"Oh, that's a good idea.
"
23,3,PC Principal,"Like, what are you thinking?
"
23,3,Liane,"I don't know.
"
23,3,Cartman,"Like, maybe, exclusive use of the tetherball court at recess for the next 2 months?
"
23,3,Liane,"Oh, w-would that be possible?
"
23,3,PC Principal,"What I care most about is the safety of the students, so if you take your shots, then I'll agree..
"
23,3,Cartman,"Sweet.
"
23,3,Liane,"Eric, you really have to do it this time, okay? When we're at the doctor's you can't change your mind.
"
23,3,Cartman," I won't change my mind.
"
23,3,Liane," Eric, it's okay! 
"
23,3,Doctor," I'm sorry, but I have a lot of other patients to see. We'll just have to try again next week. 
"
23,3,Liane,"Come on, Eric, we're going home!
"
23,3,Cartman," We're going home? You promise?
"
23,3,Liane," Let's go! Get in the car! 
"
23,3,Cartman,"Wait, can I get a toy from the toy chest?
"
23,3,Liane,"  One toy, Eric!
"
23,3,Cartman,"Cool! 
"
23,3,Randy," Yeah! 300! Tegridy Farms! Hello, South Park! Thanks for making Tegridy the most profitable farm in South park! We couldn't have done it without you, so here!  Here are some beads!  Here you go! Beads for everybody! I've got $300,000! 
China, China! 
Da da, ya ya, history
It was la lal la, China!
China, China!


 Alright, China!

"
23,3,Butters,"So then I guess the school said Eric can't come here no more, and so he's been, like, kicked out.
"
23,3,Kyle,"Cartman can't come to this school anymore?
"
23,3,Butters,"Yeah, and he was actually kind of upset about it, because he said on the phone that he has to do homeschooling with this really mean teacher.
"
23,3,Kyle,"Oh my God.  I don't know how long this will last, but I'm gonna savor every minute.
"
23,3,Cartman," Hey guys! I'm back in school! I'm allowed back, and it's all good.
"
23,3,Stan,"You got your shots?
"
23,3,Cartman,"No. I don't have to get my shots, ever!  And they can't do anything about it, because I'm a ""consciousness objector.""
"
23,3,Tolkien,"A conscientious objector?
"
23,3,Cartman,"Yeah I told the school, I said ""Look, you guys, I happen to have 'religious, moral, or philosophical convictions'."" And so- and I said ""I believe that 'health and disease should not be controlled by vaccination'."" Those are my beliefs! And besides, I don't want to risk immunizations making me artistic. 
"
23,3,Stan,"Dude, Cartman, don't you know that if you don't get immunized, you actually put people at risk who-
"
23,3,Cartman," One second, one second.  Sorry. One second, gotta sneeze.  Oh, never mind, never mind.  I'm sorry. What were you saying?
"
23,3,Stan,"I'm saying that we all had to get shots, and actually, if just one person doesn't- 
"
23,3,Cartman,"Oh! Snot web. I'll be right back, you guys.  Can somebody get me a paper towel? I got a snot web here.  Consciousness objector coming through!
"
23,3,PC Principal,"Alright everyone, listen up.  I understand your frustration, but a government organization like a school cannot impose its will on a conscientious objector..
"
23,3,Stephen,"It's not safe for our kids to be in this school! You do understand that up to 5% of kids with vaccines can still be at risk! Everyone has to do it, or it doesn't matter!
"
23,3,Thomas,"Yeah. I don't quite see how it's fair that all the rest of our community agrees to this. Why does one family get to have a problem with it?
"
23,3,Liane,"I'm sorry. It's just my strong, personal belief that  ""among other things, vaccines contain harmful ingredients formaldehyde, aluminum, and even mercury.""
"
23,3,Stephen,"Aw, come on, Mrs. Cartman! All major medical organizations state that vaccines are safe! The CDC, the FDA, UNICEF, and the US Department of Health!
"
23,3,Liane,"Yes, yes, I know, but...  ""We can't even risk a 0.1% chance of vaccinations making our children artistic.""
"
23,3,Jimbo,"Well, that's true. There are enough artists in the world.
"
23,3,Sheila,"Look, I don't know what kind of mother wouldn't vaccinate their child, but it's putting everyone in danger, and that's why-
"
23,3,Liane," Then you try to catch him!  You try it! Don't you people criticize me until you've taken Eric to the doctor and you've tried to hold him down! I'm a good mother! Don't you dare question if I care about my child!
"
23,3,Stuart,"Oh, shit.
"
23,3,Stephen,"Of, of course you care. Nobody likes seeing their child in pain. Maybe... maybe you should just let us take care of getting Eric his shots.
"
23,3,Liane," You don't understand how hard it is!
"
23,3,Stephen,"We'll find a way to make it completely painless for him, okay?
"
23,3,Stephen,"Alright, alright. Bring him in.  The little boy's room is upstairs.
"
23,3,Liane," Oh, I don't know if I can go through with this. My little Eric is going to be so mad at me!
"
23,3,Stephen,"Look, by the time he knows what's happened it'll already be over.
"
23,3,Liane,"Did you bring his boo-boo present?
"
23,3,Stephen,"Yes, yes. Come on, Thomas and Laura!  Okay, see? We got the present, everything's gonna be fine. 
"
23,3,Cartman," Hey, what's going on?  No, no. Nooooo! 
"
23,3,Doctor 2,"It'll just be for a second!
"
23,3,Stephen," Oh, Jesus! 
"
23,3,Liane,"Eric, there's a big treat for you if you stay still!
"
23,3,Linda Stotch,"Catch him! 
"
23,3,Stephen,"Thomas! Linda! Yo-you gotta get him! 
"
23,3,Liane,"Eric! Oh! 
"
23,3,Gerald,"Well, what do we do now?
"
23,3,Stephen,"I think the only way we're goin' to get Eric immunized is by bringing in an expert.
"
23,3,Murph," This is Big Mesquite Murph. How can I help you? You say you got yourself a conscientious objector? Well, you just sit tight. There aren't never no hog that Big Mesquite Murph couldn't catch.
"
23,3,Randy," How many thousand dollars has Tegridy Farms made selling weed? $300,000!  It's a 300-palooza!  Come on down and see what we've got! 
"
23,3,Deep voices,"WHAT WE'VE GOT.
"
23,3,Randy,"We've got $300,000, just selling  all this weed!  And this month we're celebrating all our new customers in China!  We're celebrating with new T-shirts!  ""Tegridy Farms made $300,000 and all I got was high."" Get yours for just ten bucks! ' We couldn't have done it without you! Remember, that's $300,000!  Well? What'd you think, guys?
"
23,3,Sharon,"How much did you spend making that commercial?
"
23,3,Randy,"Who cares, Sharon? Business is up.
"
23,3,Sharon,"Nobody cares about your stupid $300,000! We've become the kind of business that we moved out here to get away from! You know why the Chinese buy our weed?! It's to plant on their student protesters so they can put them in jail!
"
23,3,Randy,"Yeah. We make money either way.
"
23,3,Sharon,"You don't care how anyone else feels! We bought this farm together, Randy! Or did you forget that?! 
"
23,3,Shelley,"I hate marijuana! 
"
23,3,Randy," Shelley!
"
23,3,Stan,"I hate marijuana too! 
"
23,3,Randy," Stan!
"
23,3,Liane,"Oh, Eric. I... wasn't sure if you'd be up yet.  Eric, you know I only want what's best for my snookums.
"
23,3,Cartman,"You read me a bedtime story. You tucked me in. And then you let half the town into my room to try and give me a shot against my will.
"
23,3,Liane,"It was supposed to make it easier on you, a-and they didn't catch you anyway.
"
23,3,Cartman," This is goodbye, Mom! I can't live with you anymore! 
"
23,3,Liane,"Eric, please! You don't know how hard it is to be a parent! Sometimes we don't know the right thing to do!
"
23,3,Cartman,"So you go along with society and and try to force immunizations on me, even knowing the health risks! What if immunizations made my friend Timmy the way he is?! What if they made Jimmy the way he is?! What if they made Tolkien the way he is?
"
23,3,Liane,"Eric, when I was at the store, I bought you some Little Debbie creme pies and-
"
23,3,Cartman,"That isn't gonna work this time, Mom! I don't want to be around you anymore!  So I don't know where you're gonna stay, but you'll just have to figure it out! I've already packed your things. 
"
23,3,Liane,"Sweetie, you can't live on your own.
"
23,3,Cartman,"You should have thought of that before you made this house a nightmare for me. Goodbye, Mother! 
"
23,3,Murph," Alright, young'un. We can do this the easy way, or we can do it hard. 
"
23,3,Cartman,"Weeaak! No, no! 
"
23,3,Murph,"Yeeee-haaww!  Suuuweee! 
"
23,3,Stephen,"Well, what happened?
"
23,3,Murph,"I ain't never seen no hog like that. It's like it could in two places at once.
"
23,3,Stephen,"You said you could catch him!
"
23,3,Murph,"Well I did catch him! Got him locked up in a pen! It's just every time I bring out that needle, he becomes like a hog tornado! But I'll get 'im!
"
23,3,Richard,"Yeah. Or maybe you just believe a little bit that vaccinations shouldn't be mandated for school attendance due to possible still-unknown side effects.
"
23,3,Murph," Don't you question me. If anyone believes the most common side effect of vaccines, anaprophylaxis, occurs in only 1 per several hundred thousand to one per million vaccinations, it's Big Mesquite Murph! Now this hog you got here, he's contained, but now I need help getting him his shots. The only way we're gonna get him, is we gotta build a big enclosed pen, about a hundred feet in diameter. I'm also gonna need the best wranglers flown in from Wichita. And I'm gonna need some loud music, and some barbecue.
"
23,3,Stephen,"Barbecue?
"
23,3,Randy,"Mrs. Cartman?
"
23,3,Liane,"Hello, Randy. I'm... sorry to trouble you, but... I don't know where to turn. I was hoping maybe... I could buy some gumdrops.
"
23,3,Randy,"Whoa whoa! What's goin' on?
"
23,3,Liane,"My son.. hates me. The whole town... hates me. Nobody thinks I'm a good mom,  and I don't know if I am anymore!
"
23,3,Randy,"Okay, okay. Come on. Let's get you inside and get you some weed. 
"
23,3,Liane,"It all happened gradually, you know?  I don't know why everyone's against me. Even my own son. 
"
23,3,Randy,"Believe me, I know how that feels.  You try to do what's best for your family and all you do is get shit on. 
"
23,3,Liane,"I know immunizations are probably for the best,  but then you read some of this stuff on the Internet  and, I don't know, it's scary.
"
23,3,Randy,"That's just it.  When it comes to families, we have to do what we think is best.
"
23,3,Liane,"It doesn't matter. They're having an all-county mandated immunization roundup tonight. Any child not immunized is about to be.
"
23,3,Randy,"All-county immunization roundup? What's that?
"
23,3,Announcer,"Good evenin' everybody, and welcome to the CDC Child Immunization Challenge. This here special event is sponsored by Voices for Vaccines and also by Chevy. So with all that out the way, let's get to some action!  First up, we have Danny Ray Johnson out of Bailey, Colorado. He has not been immunized since kindergarten. He says he just don't like needles. 
"
23,3,Danny,"No! Nooo- 
"
23,3,Announcer,"And there they go! 
"
23,3,Danny,"No! Nooo- 
"
23,3,Cartman,"Ah, AAAH! 
"
23,3,Announcer,"He stuck him in the left buttocks; that is an 8.7 score right there.  Alright, let's hear it for little Danny Ray, folks.  He's a little worse for wear, but now he can pick himself up a nice little toy from the toy chest. 
"
23,3,Cartman," I've gotta get out of here!
"
23,3,Randy,"It's just... it's like, can't people see us trying to do what's best for my family? I'm trying to provide for them by running a business. I'm sorry if I make mistakes.
"
23,3,Liane,"I know, Randy. Other parents expect me to deal with Eric-
"
23,3,Randy,"And I get it from both sides, because my family's pissed off at me too.
"
23,3,Liane,"...I understand.
"
23,3,Randy,"No, you don't!
"
23,3,Liane,"Yes, I do.
"
23,3,Randy," No, you don't! Nobody understands.
"
23,3,Liane,"Randy, we both tried to do the best for our family.  And sometimes, when we're afraid of being judged, we can push our family away.
"
23,3,Randy,"Yeah, like, everybody's doing business with China. It's like ""get over it.""
"
23,3,Liane,"You should just feel lucky that you have a partner in doing what's right for your family.
"
23,3,Randy,"I am. I'm afraid I haven't been very kind to that partner lately. I think maybe it's time for an apology.
"
23,3,Liane,"Thanks for the talk, Randy. And for the weed. 
"
23,3,Randy,"Where are you going?
"
23,3,Liane," I'm going to do the only thing I know how to do: be a mom. 
"
23,3,Announcer,"All right, and that is Dr. Chet Mowlins that just gave that girl her DTaP booster  and her HPV vaccination. That is for genital warts. Way to go, Chet. Hey, folks, let's hear it for all these wranglers tonight. They're working extra-hard to bring immunity to your community.  Alright, folks, we are now ready for the main event. This young man has never had a single immunization.  He says he's an orthodox Jew and a conscientious objector.  Everyone put your hands together now for little Eric ""The South Park Piggy"" Cartman. 
"
23,3,Murph," Suuuuwieee! 
"
23,3,Announcer,"There he goes, folks. Dear Lord, he's a slippery one.
"
23,3,Randy,"Do you remember we used to come here and look over the town lights together?
"
23,3,Towelie,"...Yeah, so what?! Then you turned into an asshole!
"
23,3,Randy,"I brought you here to apologize, Towelie. I let the money go to my head. I... I got greedy and I started acting like a towel. I need you back. I need Tegridy back, the way it used to be.
"
23,3,Towelie,"No more harassin' homegrowers?
"
23,3,Randy,"No more harassing homegrowers.
"
23,3,Towelie,"No more dealin' with those Med Men assholes?
"
23,3,Randy,"No more Med Men.
"
23,3,Towelie,"No more kissin' China's ass?
"
23,3,Randy,"China's actually a free and loving country that-
"
23,3,Towelie,"I'm out. 
"
23,3,Randy," Wait, wait, Towelie, come on! I need you!
"
23,3,Towelie," I'm never workin' for a company that's regulated by a communist government!
"
23,3,Randy,"Okay, okay. No more selling to the Chinese.
"
23,3,Towelie,"Then say it! Say ""Fuck the Chinese government!""
"
23,3,Randy," Fuck the Chinese government.
"
23,3,Towelie,"I didn't hear you!
"
23,3,Randy,"Fuck the Chinese government! There!
"
23,3,Towelie,"...Well... you just got your partner back. 
"
23,3,Randy,"Hahaha! This is it. This is the moment that Tegridy Farms got back on track.
"
23,3,Announcer,"Dear Lord, we are going on 16 minutes here and ain't nobody caught this young'un. This might very well be a world record you're seeing here, folks.
"
23,3,Liane," Get out of my way! Move it!
"
23,3,Stephen,"Whoa whoa, Mrs. Cartman. Everything is fine here. 
"
23,3,Sheila," It's okay, Liane. They know what they're doing. 
"
23,3,Announcer,"Oh, looks like we got a concerned parent in there trying to take issue with their child's well-being. 
"
23,3,Cartman,"Mom! 
"
23,3,Liane,"Leave my son a  lone!  AHHHH!
"
23,3,Crowd,"OHHHH! 
"
23,3,Liane," I know I'm not the greatest mom in the world. I do the best I can. Whatever happens now is going to be done my way. Come on, Eric. 
"
23,3,Cartman," Wait, Mom? 
"
23,3,Liane," No, Eric! No shot, no toy!
"
23,3,Cartman,"What?! 
"
23,3,Cartman,"Okay, doctor. I'm ready for my shot.
"
23,3,Doctor,"Eric, I've been speaking with your mother. I'm afraid there's some bad news.
"
23,3,Cartman,"Bad news? What are you talking about? Mom?
"
23,3,Doctor,"Your mother received a heavy dose of vaccine that wasn't meant for an adult. I'm afraid there have been... side effects.
"
23,3,Cartman," What side effects? MOM?  MOM!  Mom, are you here, Mo- 
"
23,3,Liane," Eric...
"
23,3,Cartman,"Noooooooo... Noooooooo...
"
23,4,Randy,"Good morning, everyone. 'morning. So, listen guys. We are not in good shape. The whole ""doing business in China"" thing has sort of bitten us in the ass,  and now we aren't selling enough weed to keep up with our costs.  You see this? This right here? That's us plateauing. We no longer get any of that sweet Chinese money, and now, all the money we do make doesn't even cover our expenses.  So,  how do we sell more weed? Stan.
"
23,4,Stan," I don't know... Do like a sale. Like, a Fall sale?
"
23,4,Randy,"Not good enough! Shelly?!
"
23,4,Shelly,"I hate marijuana.
"
23,4,Randy,"Nice attitude! How do we sell more weed? Sharon?
"
23,4,Sharon,"If you don't make commercials or do more parades for the town, we'd have more money.
"
23,4,Randy,"Right. Cut out all our marketing. That's Sharon's great idea, everyone. Towelie?
"
23,4,Towelie,"You know what the problem is? It's the schwag. All those stands and seeds, they just go to waste, man.
"
23,4,Randy,"Go on.
"
23,4,Towelie,"It's like, we sell all the good parts of the weed, but we throw away, like, tons and tons of all the leftover shit. You can sell that crap as mulch to a hardware company.
"
23,4,Randy,"Mulch.  Use our discarded product to recover costs.  Everyone, great job. You just got powned by a towel.
"
23,4,Cartman,"
 '' It's Sloppy Joe day!


"
23,4,Cartman and Butters,"
 '' It's Sloppy Joe day!


"
23,4,Cartman,"I seriously think that Sloppy Joe day is my favorite day at school.
"
23,4,Butters,"Yeah, it's the best.
"
23,4,Cartman and Butters,"
 '' Sloppy Joe day! It's Sloppy Joe day! 


"
23,4,A new Cook,"Come on, keep the line moving, kids! 
"
23,4,Cartman,"What is this?
"
23,4,Cook,"That's today's lunch. It's ""feesh.""
"
23,4,Cartman,"Feesh?
"
23,4,Butters,"But, but this is Sloppy Joe day.
"
23,4,Cook,"Yeah? Well, the menu's been changed. We had kids complainin' our food wasn't healthy or sustainable enough, so don't you start bitchin' about it now.
"
23,4,Cartman,"What kids were complaining about health and sustainability?! What kids would care at all that-  the girls!
"
23,4,Butters,"The girls?
"
23,4,Cartman,"The fucking girls!  Excuse me?! Can someone explain to us why this  is on our lunch trays?!
"
23,4,Butters,"Yeah, it's supposed to be sloppy Joe day!
"
23,4,Wendy,"We asked for healthier options and to sometimes have food for those of us who don't eat red meat.
"
23,4,Cartman,"Oh my God. I'm about to lose my mind.  You think you can just mess with a man's lunch?!
"
23,4,Butters,"It's okay, Eric. I-
"
23,4,Cartman,"You think that your ideas about health and nutrition should be somehow interfering with mine?!
"
23,4,Butters,"Eric, Eric!
"
23,4,Cartman,"You dictate what foods I can eat?!  Urgh 
"
23,4,Butters,"Eric, Eric?
"
23,4,Cartman,"I can't, I can't. Butters, I can't. 
"
23,4,Paramedic 1,"Clear! 
"
23,4,Smith,"We got him back!
"
23,4,Cartman,"Agh. Fuck you, Wendy.
"
23,4,Randy,"How much do you think we'll get for our mulch?
"
23,4,Towelie,"Even if we only get 10 cents a pound, we have like a million pounds of it.
"
23,4,Randy,"This is gonna save our business. I'm really hungry all of a sudden. You want some Burger King?
"
23,4,Towelie,"Yeah, I'll take some onion rings. 
"
23,4,Clerk,"Welcome to Burger King. Can I take your order?
"
23,4,Randy,"Uh, hi, can I get, um, large onion rings... the big Coke Zero and, um... What's an Impossible Burger?
"
23,4,Clerk,"It's a plant-based burger, sir.
"
23,4,Randy,"Plant-based? You mean, it's not like a cow?
"
23,4,Clerk,"No, sir. It's completely vegan, but it's engineered to replicate the taste and texture of beef.
"
23,4,Randy,"Hoh. Okay, I'll try it.  Hey. This tastes like shit. You guys make money off of this?
"
23,4,Clerk,"They're very popular, sir. A lot of people care about the environment and sustainability.
"
23,4,Randy,"Aw that, that's amazing. I mean, this seriously tastes like dog shit, and you get people to buy it?  Wait a minute... Plant-based... Plant... based... Plant-based. Oh my God.
"
23,4,Butters,"Comin' through! Make way! 
"
23,4,Cartman,"Hey guys. How's it goin'?
"
23,4,Craig,"You're out of the hospital?
"
23,4,Cartman,"Yes. The girls tried to kill me, but they did not succeed. However, we cannot let the girls' protest ruin our lunch ever again!
"
23,4,Nichole,"Oh, give me a break!  It's not just girls who wanna change the menu, it's boys too!
"
23,4,Boy,"Yeah. I want vegan food.
"
23,4,Millie,"A lot of students are protesting!
"
23,4,Cartman,"Well, their protesting is ruining my lunch!
"
23,4,Boy,"We have a right to free speech.
"
23,4,Cartman,"Yes, we do all have freedom of speech! But at times, there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you're not thinking about others and you're ONLY THINKING ABOUT YOURSELF!
"
23,4,Mr. Mackey," Whoawhoawhoawhoa, what's goin' on, kids?
"
23,4,Butters,"The protesters are tryin' to kill Eric again, Mr. Mackey.
"
23,4,Mr. Mackey,"Okay, kids, we don't want another incident here, okay?
"
23,4,Cartman,"They're trying to take people's lunch! They don't realize it harms people financially, physically, emotionally, and spiritually. 
"
23,4,Mr. Mackey,"Eric, it's okay. We aren't going to change the school menu, okay? Everything's fine.
"
23,4,Boy,"That's not fair!
"
23,4,Nichole,"Doesn't it matter we're being silenced?!
"
23,4,Cartman,"Agagagh, my lunch!
"
23,4,Mr. Mackey,"Girls, I'm sorry, but the health of our students has to come first.
"
23,4,Randy,"Gerald, thanks for coming! You're not gonna believe this!
"
23,4,Gerald,"Believe what? Your text said that-
"
23,4,Randy,"Come on come on come on.  I think I've perfected it, Gerald. I made a sustainable, healthy alternative to meat. I want you to try it. 
"
23,4,Gerald,"It's a hamburger?
"
23,4,Randy,"It's a Tegridy burger. Go ahead, try it.  Well?
"
23,4,Gerald,"This tastes like shit.
"
23,4,Randy,"Yeah. It's plant-based. But keep eating it, though.
"
23,4,Gerald," I just- I just don't think it's very good.
"
23,4,Randy,"Wait for it. Wait for it...
"
23,4,Gerald," Oh. 
"
23,4,Randy,"Yeah ha ha?
"
23,4,Gerald,"Yeah, it's good.
"
23,4,Randy,"Yeah, right?
"
23,4,Gerald," Whoa. It's really fucking good, man! This is like the best burger I've ever had!
"
23,4,Randy,"And you can eat a lot of them and not feel bloated. Towelie's had like 12. 
"
23,4,Towelie,"Best burgers I ever had.
"
23,4,Cartman," Ohm... oh my God. School cafeteria ribs. After all that yogurt and crap they gave me at the hospital? OHM.
"
23,4,Butters,"I looove barbecue rib day.
"
23,4,Cartman,"Yeah. I think maybe I like rib day even more than sloppy Joe day. It's a difficult choice.
"
23,4,Wendy,"Everyone? Everyone, can I have your attention, please?  Look, guys. We're supposed to be the young generation, right? We're the ones upset about the world our parents left us.
"
23,4,Nichole,"Yeah, but eating this kind of food makes us all just as guilty.
"
23,4,Wendy,"The millions and millions of cows and pigs and chickens that we harvest every year  are a huge reason for climate change.
"
23,4,Nichole,"It is up to us, as students, to protest for change.
"
23,4,Boy,"Young voices matter!
"
23,4,Wendy,"Without sustainable and ethical food choices now, we're proving to be no d-
"
23,4,Cartman," AAAH! GAAAH!  CAN I PLEASE JUST ENJOY MY LUNCH FOR FIVE GODDAMNED MINUTES?!
"
23,4,Butters,"You gotta calm down, Eric. Remember your condition, Eric.
"
23,4,Cartman,"We all have freedom of speech, but stop talking about climate change DURING LUNCH TIME!
"
23,4,Butters,"Okay. that's it, Eric.
"
23,4,Cartman,"Some of us can just enjoy some simple goddamned barbecue ribs! And I- Daah!  Oh God, they did it again to me, Butters.
"
23,4,Butters,"Eric!
"
23,4,Cartman,"I think this is the Big One! Don't let me die.
"
23,4,Butters,"Somebody help!
"
23,4,Cartman,"Don't let me die. Don't let me die, Butters. 
"
23,4,Paramedic 1,"Clear! 
"
23,4,Smith,"We got him back!
"
23,4,Cartman,"Agh. Fuck you, Wendy.
"
23,4,Clerk,"So that's one Whopper, one order of chicken strings, and a medium beverage. Is there any-? 
"
23,4,Randy," Burgers! Get your burgers here!
"
23,4,Clerk,"Uh okay, that'll be fift-
"
23,4,Randy,"Plant-based burgers for sale!
"
23,4,Clerk,"Excuse me one moment. 
"
23,4,Randy,"Get your hamburgers here!  Plant-based burgers for sale!
"
23,4,Clerk," Hey, what are you doing?
"
23,4,Randy,"I'm sellin' hamburgers. All-natural, completely plant-based.  Thank you, sir.
"
23,4,Clerk,"You can't sell hamburgers here! This is a Burger King!
"
23,4,Towelie,"You sell hamburgers here.
"
23,4,Randy,"Yeah, you sell hamburgers here.
"
23,4,Customer,"This is seriously as good or better than a real hamburger. Can I get a couple more to take to work?
"
23,4,Clerk,"Hey! Now look, buddy! I'm not gonna lose customers because of YOU!  We have plant-based burgers inside as well! Come try our Impossible Burger.
"
23,4,Randy,"Tegridy Burger. Made locally right here in South Park. Tegridy Burger.
"
23,4,Clerk,"STOP that!
"
23,4,PC Principal,"Alright everyone, listen up! As you know, there are several students protesting the school menu. But there are other students who are voicing their concerns against changes. Eric Cartman is still recovering in the hospital, we all wish him well.  Now, the school has been looking into several options to deal with the problem, and I do believe we have found a compromise. We have found a new company in the plant-based fast-food industry who would like to be the supplier for our cafeteria. And so please welcome the founder of Incredible Meat. 
"
23,4,Incredible Meat founder,"Hello, children. I want to thank you and I want to thank your fine principal for hearing me out. I take plants, and I process them into goo. I'm a goo man. I have factories all over the country. I have trucks right now loaded with goo that can be here within the week. The goo I speak of can be made into anything. It can be made into tacos. It can be made into hot dogs. And I promise you that none of you students will know the difference. I would very much like to be the plant-based meat vendor for your school. I would like to be the plant-based meat vendor for your town. I'm a simple family man and a vegetarian. I would like the opportunity to make you all vegetarians as well, and I thank you.
"
23,4,Randy,"Eating meat doesn't just hurt animals. It hurts people. It takes 13 pounds of grain to produce just one pound of animal meat. All that plant food could be used much more efficiently if-m, if people just ate it directly. Meat is also not environmentally friendly. Meat production is wasteful and causes enormous amounts of pollution. And the meat industry is one of the biggest...  ...Huh? Oh, I was just saying...  that adopting a vegan diet is way more effective than switching to a greener car in the fight against climate change. For your health, for our planet, for the animals and for each other, we have to switch to plant-based foods. Now, it just so happens-
"
23,4,Clerk,"You gotta be kidding me!
"

23,4,Cook,"They're... Incredible Beef... tacos.

"
23,4,Mr. Kim,"You mean instead of City Chicken I could have Incredibre City Chicken?
"
23,4,Goo Man,"That is correct.
"
23,4,Mr. Kim,"You mean instead of City Mongorian Beef I could have Inrcedibry City Mongorian Beef?
"
23,4,Goo Man,"That's right.
"
23,4,Mr. Kim,"You're saying now I could have scallops with Incredibry City XO sauce?! Okay, sign me up!

23,4,Rancher,"I'm the biggest cattle rancher in South Park. I made ma livin' 62-odd years before you fancy plant growers done showed up and put me out of a job!
"
23,4,Randy,"Well I'm sorry, Mr. Cow Killer, but this is called ""evolution.""
"
23,4,Rancher,"I got 300 cows that the world suddenly decided they got no use fer! What am I supposed to do with them?! Put them in a zoo?! What they gonna do now? Go start some cow circus?!

"
23,4,Butters,"...Teacher?

23,4,Cartman,"Lunchtime!

23,4,Mr. Mackey,"Walk, don't run, m'kay?

23,4,Cartman,"Hey Butters!  Wait up, dude. You know what today is, right? It's Salisbury Steak day! Salisbury Steak day! 
"
23,4,Both,"It's Salis-
"
23,4,Butters," -bury Steak day! 
"
23,4,Cartman,"Butters, is something going on? Your lunch dances aren't the same.
"
23,4,Butters,"Eric, I. I just hate lying to you. I mean, you've been in the hospital. Twice. I feel guilty.
"
23,4,Cartman,"Guilty... about what?
"
23,4,Butters,"It's our lunches, Eric. It's... Incredible Meat.
"
23,4,Cartman,"Yes, I think it's pretty good.
"
23,4,Butters,"No, Eric. See, there was this guy. He's a goo man.
"
23,4,Cartman,"The fuck is a goo man?
"
23,4,Randy," Go on! shoo! Hey! Goddamnit!  I don't know what we're gonna do. These cows are eating all our weed and they're shitting everywhere. They're gonna put us completely out of business!
"
23,4,Towelie,"Did you find anyone else to take 'em?
"
23,4,Randy,"Nobody wants cows anymore! They're bad for climate change!  We gotta kill 'em.
"
23,4,Towelie,"What?!
"
23,4,Randy,"They're ruining our burger business! We gotta kill all these cows!
"
23,4,Towelie,"How are we gonna do that?
"
23,4,Randy,"Look, it's not gonna be easy. It's not something anyone wants to do but... we're just gonna have to get really, really high.
"
23,4,Randy,"Yeeheeyeah! 
"
23,4,Towelie,"Yeee-haw! 
"
23,4,Goo Man,"I've been in your town a little while now. What I see is a community that is ready for change. You see, I am a goo man.  What I serve in your school cafeteria is a synthetically-modulated plant protein. I have taken over nearly all the fast food restaurants here in town and teamed up with the fine people in your community.  This my new regional manager, H.W.
"
23,4,Clerk,"It's Rick.
"
23,4,Goo Man,"  Shut up, H.W.  You see, I'm trying to reach all the school cafeterias, all the stadiums, fast food restaurants, all the places that serve shitty food and serve shitty goo.  The goo for these kind of places is made in a factory.  It's made in a lab.  It's just down-market goo.  But I can tell people it's healthy and earth friendly,  and I can send my goo through a network of pipes running all the way to the ocean.  So, that it can be eaten by people who eat crappy food anyway -- from coast to coast.
"
23,4,Cartman,"  And that's what we have for school lunch now? That's what all the kids decided while I wasn't there?
"
23,4,Goo Man,"But you see, it doesn't work unless I own all the crappy food places. Mr. Rancher? 
"
23,4,Rancer,"Y-Yes sir. Mr. Goo Man?
"
23,4,Goo Man,"Have you done what I've asked you to do?
"
23,4,Rancher,"It's all done, sir. You'll have everything you need.
"
23,4,Goo Man," Well if you don't mind boys, I have work to tend to.
"
23,4,Cartman,"Me too. I need to have a word with the students at my school. 
"
23,4,Butters,"  Oh, God, Eric! What are you gonna do?!
"
23,4,News Anchor,"It has become the most popular burger in Colorado. The plant-based Tegridy Burger is changing the way people think about food.  All over the state, people are turning vegan and eating more ethical sustainable meat.
"
23,4,Bll Keegan,"  I'm standing now with Randy Marsh, the owner of Tegridy Burger, and, Mr. Marsh, you must be pretty excited. 
"
23,4,Randy,"Yeah, you know, we're all just -- We're all just bein' healthy and ethical over here!
"
23,4,Bll Keegan,"Uh-huh, and, Mr. Marsh, what about  the student protests coming out against your burger right now?!
"
23,4,Randy," Huh?
"
23,4,Bll Keegan,"Students are coming forward, saying that Tegridy Farms is unethical and hypocritical.
"
23,4,Rick," That's right! Tegridy Burger is a fraud! We caught their farm on camera. Just take a look!
"
23,4,Bll Keegan,"We warn you, the following footage is graphic.  
"
23,4,Randy,"Huhuhuh! 
"
23,4,Bll Keegan,"Mr. Marsh, what do you have to say about these images? 
"
23,4,Randy,"Oh, hey. Fuck you! Oh, they were -- They were just -- We didn't eat 'em!
"
23,4,Cartman,"Hey, guys, looks like I almost missed lunch.
"
23,4,Butters," Oh, God. Someone's gonna die.
"
23,4,Cartman,"I found out about what we're eating here at the school. I found out what it's made of and where!
"
23,4,Mr. Mackey," N-Now, Eric, stay calm, mm-kay! We're sorry. We were just trying to find a compromise! Now just be calm.
"
23,4,Cartman,"What are you sorry about? It's me who owes all you guys an apology.  I thought you guys were all trying to force me to eat healthy, but I've learned that a lot of this stuff is made in a factory and processed with tons of salt just like all my favorite foods! SpaghettiOs, Rice-A-Roni... Here I was thinking what you wanted was stuff from a farmers market. I just didn't want my food to change. School cafeteria meat is just processed crap that comes in a box, and this is... just processed crap that comes in a box.  I don't have a problem with it. All I wanted was to be able to eat the same garbage I always have, and this is definitely garbage. And hey, if it happens to be more ethical and sustainable, well, I guess I'm fine with that, too. So, you see, guys? There was actually no reason to protest! We were actually all on the same page all the time! At least we learned that freedom of speech truly doesn't matter! Come on, let's eat!  ♪ It's Processed Meat-Like Substance Day ♪ It's Processed Meat-Like Substance Day ♪
"
23,5,Randy," It's the most wonderful time of the year.  Well? You all excited, gang?
"
23,5,Stan,"For Halloween? I guess so.
"
23,5,Randy,"Ugh, this isn't any Halloween, because this week, Tegridy Weed is doing a Halloween special. It's big promotional thing. Everyone's gonna love it. Hey, wuh-where's Shelly?
"
23,5,Sharon,"Shelly hasn't come out of her room in two days.
"
23,5,Randy,"Why?
"
23,5,Sharon," You know why, Randy.
"
23,5,Randy," Yeah. Yeah. 
"
23,5,Randy,"Hey, Shelly? Can I talk to you for a minute?
"
23,5,Shelly,"What do you want?
"
23,5,Randy,"Come on, kiddo.  Come talk with your old man, huh? Come on now.  Shelly, we need to talk about your marijuana problem. You know, what's your problem with it?
"
23,5,Shelly,"I hate marijuana!
"
23,5,Randy,"Yes, we all know, but ugh, why?
"
23,5,Shelly,"It stinks, and it makes everyone in this town dumber than they already are!
"
23,5,Randy,"Shelly, the truth is, some of the most important people in the world smoke weed. Did you know that Snoop Dogg smokes weed?
"
23,5,Shelly,"Yes, everyone knows Snoop Dogg is a stupid pothead!
"
23,5,Randy,"Ugh, way more people enjoy marijuana than you think, okay? Okay, who's your idol? Who do you most look up to in the whole world?
"
23,5,Shelly,"Serena Williams.
"
23,5,Randy,"Total stoner. High as a kite. Every tennis match.
"
23,5,Shelly,"No she's not!
"
23,5,Randy,"You don't know that, Shelly! Now you're just making assumptions!
"
23,5,Shelly,"Everyone in this country is getting dumber, and I wish Marijuana was illegal again!
"
23,5,Randy," Shelly!  Okay, loook. The thing is, this problem you're having with marijuana? It's just got to stop, okay? We're working on out Tegridy Farms Halloween Special, okay?? Nobody wants a giant bummer ruining it! I love you! 
"
23,5,Butters," Whoa. Very impressive.  Indeed. 
"
23,5,Stephen," Find anything good, Butters/
"
23,5,Butters,"One minute, Dad! Archeologist Butters just needs to get his stamp and sticker for his autograph book.  Aha! another rare find!
"
23,5,Stephen,"Well, did you all enjoy the museum, gang?
"
23,5,Butters,"Well wait wait, we can't leave yet! I got all the stickers and tamps except for one!
"
23,5,Stephen,"Well I'm pretty sure we saw the whole exhibit.
"
23,5,Butters,"Can I just check around one last time?
"
23,5,Stephen,"Alright, Archeologist Butters, but then meet us back right here.
"
23,5,Butters,"Well o-kay!
"
23,5,Guide,"What you're seeing here are original knots which were joined in the main pieces of the Khufu boat. The cedar timbers of the boat's hull were lashed together with hemp rope, a technique used until-
"
23,5,Randy,"Whoa! Whoa! Wait just one second! Are you actually saying that hemp, a classification of cannabis , was actually used by he ancient Egyptians? 
"
23,5,Guide,"Well yes. In fact, it's been found that cannabis was used by Egyptians for its medical properties as well.
"
23,5,Randy,"Hold the freaking phone! You're telling us that marijuana has been used throughout the centuries-?
"
23,5,Shelly,"Is this why you brought me here?
"
23,5,Randy,"No, I d-, I'm just, I'm surprised that-
"
23,5,Shelly,"You said you wanted a special day with just your daughter. You said a father-daughter day at the museum could help us connect.
"
23,5,Randy,"And, and it is, Shelly. We're havin' a great time!
"
23,5,Shelly,"I don't care if Egyptians used stupid pot! 
"
23,5,Randy," She has a marijuana problem. Shelly! 
"
23,5,Butters,"Been there... Saw that... Where's that stupid last sticker stamp?  What's this? 
"
23,5,Butters,"Whoa...  ""Sarcophagus and mummified remains of Egyptian royalty."" This is it! My last sticker! 
"
23,5,Jud," That's the mummy of Took-tan Ra. You don't wanna put that stamp in your sticker book. Nobody puts that stamp in their sticker book.
"
23,5,Butters,"But this is my last one!
"
23,5,Jud,"It's got a curse on it. Ancient love cure not fit for any child. You can look at the mummy all you like, but... you don't want that stamp... in your sticker book.
"
23,5,Butters," Haha, that's okay. I'm no ordinary child. I am Archeologist Butters!  Happy Halloween, Mister!
"
23,5,Jud," For some of us, maybe.
"
23,5,Randy,"It's just so hard being a parent sometimes, you know? I've tried everything to get through to my daughter. I took her to a laser show, I played her all of Dark Side Of The Moon, but... it's like... it's like there's something in her head that just doesn't get it!
"
23,5,Towelie,"That's awful, Randy. I'm sorry.
"
23,5,Randy,"It's just- I have to live my life, you know? I can't let her problems with marijuana drag me down anymore.
"
23,5,Towelie,"No, you're right You're totally right.
"
23,5,Randy,"So, anyway, hey. How's the Halloween Special comin' along?
"
23,5,Towelie,"The Halloween Special? Oh it's ready.
"
23,5,Randy,"It's ready?
"
23,5,Towelie,"Yeah, it's right over here. 
"
23,5,Randy,"O-ho wow! The Halloween Special! I'm so excited to try it.
"
23,5,Towelie,"Yeah, it's basically a hybrid of our Tegridy Gold and Colorado Kush. Turned out really great, I think.
"
23,5,Randy," Oh, wow, that is nice! I'd like to see anyone compete with this Halloween Special.
"
23,5,Butters,"M-Mon?  ...Dad?  A little... Why. Oh. Okay. Oh. Okay. Okay. Oh that's okay.  That's okay. There you go.  Form, for me? Oh, thank you.  Oh wow! A Fitbit!  Why thank you. Thank you. I... actually already have a Fitbit, but I could-
"
23,5,Mummy,"Huh?!
"
23,5,Butters,"I could give this one to a friend.  I just... I have one, so... 
"
23,5,Shelly,"Furniture polish, paint thinner and bleach.Ammonia and antifreeze. One tablespoon each.I hate everybody, I just like to read.Everyone's stupid. They smoke too much weed.So with this eldritch potion and these ancient wordsI make my revenge upon all the turds.
"
23,5,Officer Brown,"Butters Stotch?
"
23,5,Butters,"Yes sir?
"
23,5,Officer Brown,"We want to ask you some questions about what happened in town last night.
"
23,5,Butters,"what... happened in town?
"
23,5,Officer,"People were attacked by an ancient Egyptian mummy. It killed five people and destroyed everything it could.
"
23,5,Butters," Oh, uh, a mummy, huh? That's, that's weird.
"
23,5,Officer Brown,"Oh, you just think that's weird? Because the mummy said you two got in some kind of altercation last night.
"
23,5,Butters,"What?? The mummy talked to you??
"
23,5,Officer,"Is it true, sir, that you and the mummy  ""got into an argument over a gift you didn't seem to appreciate""?
"
23,5,Butters,"There was no argument. I just said I already had it and I'd give it to a friend.
"
23,5,Officer Brown,"A present that the mummy got for you?
"
23,5,Butters,"I, I just goh-
"
23,5,Officer Brown,"You can see how that could be pretty hurtful.
"
23,5,Officer,"Did you throw the mummy out of your house?
"
23,5,Butters,"No! I didn't throw the mummy out of the house! The mummy got all pissed off at me and left! 
"
23,5,Officer Brown,"You're gonna have to share in the damages here, son.
"
23,5,Butters,"But I didn't do anything wrong! Okay, look officers, I think  I'm under some kind of curse.
"
23,5,Officer,"Well that's what the mummy told us about you.
"
23,5,Officer Brown,"You got a summons to appear in court. Until then I just suggest you and the mummy stay away from each other. 
"
23,5,Randy,"Oh, man, I really like it.
"
23,5,Towelie,"Yeah, it's smooth.
"
23,5,Randy,"It's really smooth. This is so good that we shold stop smoking it right now. We don't want to ruin our Halloween experience, you know?  This is seriously gonna be the best Halloween ever.  AAAAAAA! Shelly!
"
23,5,Shelly,"That's what I think of your stupid special! 
"
23,5,Randy,"No! Nooo!!
"
23,5,PC Principal,"Alright everyone, listen up. Halloween has almost arrived and I wanna make sure that we are all aware of certain guidelines when it comes to Halloween costumes at school. Now, I don't wanna see any FUCKING SOMBREROS! Alright, if I see any fucking Mexican sombreros, or anyone fucking dressed like a fucking Native American, I'm gonna lose my fuckin' shit! There will be no hobos, or bums, anything depicting people from low-income households.
"
23,5,Cartman,"Ahp, no Halloween for you, Kenny.
"
23,5,PC Principal,"And lastly, heed my fuckin' words. If I see any of you girls dressed as fucking Moana, I'm gonna lose my fucking mind! Alright now, the student book fair is coming up next week. We encourage all students to be able to- 
"
23,5,Butters,"...and that's all that happened. I put that stamp in the sticker book, and now this mummy is destroying everything around me. I need help.
"
23,5,Mr. Mackey,"Okay. An-and do you feel like maybe the mummy is trying to, you know, get you to react?
"
23,5,Butters,"Wuh-what, what do you mean?
"
23,5,Mr. Mackey,"Well, you know, Butters, the mummy feels like you get to do whatever you want, but it doesn't get to do whatever it wants.
"
23,5,Butters,"Wait. The mummy talked to you, too?
"
23,5,Mr. Mackey,"Yeah, yeah, we had a good talk, yeah.
"
23,5,Butters,"Why is it talking to everyone?!
"
23,5,Mr. Mackey,"I think the mummy is very insightful and cares about you a lot.
"
23,5,Butters,"No it doesn't! This is crazy!
"
23,5,Mr. Mackey,"Look, the mummy's just sad because you get to go to school and have fun, and what does the mummy get to do? You know, it just sits around being a mummy. You know, that's not fair.
"
23,5,Butters,"First of all, I don't have fun at school! And secondly... the mummy can do whatever it wants; I don't care!
"
23,5,Mr. Mackey,"Right, but you do care, Butters, because you're sitting in my office talking all about the bad things that the mummy does.
"
23,5,Towelie," Randy, quick! You gotta come see!
"
23,5,Randy,"I just need some time, okay, Towelie?
"
23,5,Towelie,"Look! You don't understand! The special! Well, it's a miracle!  Come on! You're not gonna believe it! 
"
23,5,Randy,"Alright, Towelie, what is this ab-? Whoa!  The Halloween Special!
"
23,5,Towelie,"Whatever your daughter threw on this shit made it more powerful than ever!
"
23,5,Randy," Yeah! We're back!
"
23,5,Towelie,"Yeah!
"
23,5,Randy,"Yeah! Yeah!
"
23,5,Butters,"I have to end this curse, fellas. It's getting worse every day. Last night the mummy attacked my parents, and it said I was being narcissistic. It has no reason. No logic! One minute it's destroying everything, and the next it's sending me selfies like nothing ever happened. Look!  This whole thing is so crazy it's starting to make me think I'm crazy!
"
23,5,Stan,"Well, it is a little crazy how much you talk about the mummy.
"
23,5,Butters," It's a freaking mummy! Wouldn't you talk about it?!
"
23,5,Kyle,"We're just saying, Butters, that sometimes it all seems a little codependent.
"
23,5,Cartman,"Yeah, like you and the mummy need to do your own things sometimes.
"
23,5,Butters,"I would love that, but I don't have a choice! I swear, you guys. Mummies can smell fun! Whenever I'm somewhere, and I actually start havin' a good time, I get a call or a text from the mummy sayin' ""Hey, what are you doin'?"" Like it knows.
"
23,5,Tolkien,"Well, you're kinda havin' fun now, aren't you?
"
23,5,Butters,"Yeah. It is fun to get away and just talk to you guys.  Oh, gosh darnit.  Hang on a second, fellas. 
"
23,5,Randy,"Okay, that should be enough Halloween Special for the first few people  Now, I think we should put the open bar in this area  and the hot tub maybe right here .
"
23,5,Towelie,"Yeah, that'll work well.
"
23,5,Shelly,"Dad, you have to drive me to the book fair.
"
23,5,Randy,"What what? 
"
23,5,Shelly,"Mom said you have to drive me because she's taking Stan trick-or-treating.
"
23,5,Randy," You're going to a book fair?
"
23,5,Shelly,"Yes.
"
23,5,Randy,"On fucking Halloweed?
"
23,5,Shelly,"Yes!
"
23,5,Randy," I don't even know how to deal with you anymore.  You're doing this on purpose, aren't you?!
"
23,5,Shelly," You're my dad, drive me to the book fair!
"
23,5,Randy,"I will not! I have things to get ready, and nobody cares about books on Halloween, Shelly!
"
23,5,Shelly,"The last thing people in this town need is more marijuana! 
"
23,5,Randy,"OH MY GOD! 
"
23,5,Randy," It's a nightmare! It's a personal hell! I've done everything I can, as a father, to help he with her problem, but she just ignores everything I say! I can't do this!
"
23,5,Shelly,"You're such a piece of shit, Dad!
"
23,5,Randy,"Oh, Shelly, I love you!
"
23,5,Det. Harris,"What does her mother have to say about this?
"
23,5,Randy,"Her mother doesn't say anything anymore! Whenever I bring up our daughter's marijuana problem, my wife says ""I'm gonna lose my mind if you bring this up again."" It's destroying all of us! I just think, maybe a night in jail is the wakeup call that she needs. I'm barely gonna have fun at the Halloween Special now! It's gonna be really hard for me to rage knowing you're in here, Shelly. It's gonna be really hard for me to rage! 
"
23,5,Officer Brown,"Alright, there you go.  When you have a problem with drugs and alcohol, you hurt everyone around you. Happy Halloween. 
"
23,5,Butters,"What are you in for? I'm in here because *apparently* I'm a passive-aggressive controlling and manipulative psychopath whose narcissitic behavior drives other people crazy.
"
23,5,Guest 1,"Hey, trick or treat. We're here for the Halloween Special?
"
23,5,Towelie,"All right, here you go, guys.  That's a promotional gift from Tegridy Farms.
"
23,5,Randy,"Hey, come on in, guys! There's candy and hot dogs!
"
23,5,Guest 2,"Alright. 
"
23,5,Randy,"Samplers of the special are there on the table, guys. Feel free to light up!
"
23,5,Towelie,"Wow, we're almost out, Randy. I gotta go to the barn and get some more.
"
23,5,Randy,"Okay, I'll hold down the fort. 
"
23,5,Towelie,"Jimmy crack corn and I don't care. Jimmy crack-  Uh, what? 
"
23,5,Butters,"So I said, ""Okay, fine. You don't ever do anything wrong! It's all me! You've got no problems, only I have problems! Alright, uh I'll lock my own ass up! Then we'll see who's got issues!""
"
23,5,Shelly,"Will you SHUT UP?
"
23,5,Butters,"I'll be in here, and something will go horribly wrong tonight, and then the monster will have to accept what it is, and finally work on changing, right?
"
23,5,Shelly,"Probably not.
"
23,5,Randy,"Naw, you see, fluvial geomorphology deals with the way rivers change over time. It's geology shit. It's why I got out of it, really.
"
23,5,Guest 2,"Hey man, what's in this weed? 
"
23,5,Randy,"Oh! That's a company secret, my friend!
"
23,5,Guest 1,"No, I meant I- I don't feel so good. 
"
23,5,Randy,"Hey, are you alright there, buddy?  Whoa, dude, did you see that?! 
"
23,5,Both,"AAAAA!
"
23,5,Randy,"Towelie! There's something wrong with thte special!
"
23,5,Towelie,"There's somethin' in the barn! The thing you killed! It wants revenge! 
"
23,5,Randy,"Oh Jesus! What happened?! 
"
23,5,Towelie,"It's dead because o'you! And now it wants your soul!
"
23,5,Randy," What?! What's dead because o'me?! 
"
23,5,Pooh," Oh, hello there. Would you like to die?
"
23,5,Randy," Ooooohh! Winnie the Pooh! Winnie the Pooh!
"
23,5,Officer Brown,"Detective Harris! Something's going down at the Marsh farm!
"
23,5,Officer,"Calm down, sir! I can't understand you!
"
23,5,Det. Harris,"Put him on speaker. 
"
23,5,Randy,"There's monsters everywhere! It's some kind of curse! Unspeakable evil!
"
23,5,Butters," The mummy! I told you!
"
23,5,Randy,"All different kindds of monsters! Zombies and plant people and bears! Oh my God! What's that?! Oh my God, it's Harvey Weinstein! He's got me! You've got to-argh! He's inside me! Harvey Weinstein is inside me! You've gotta send help! People are dying everywhere! No! Harvey, I said no! Please, somebody co- 
"
23,5,Det. Harris,"This is it, everyone! Let's move! All hands on deck! We've gotta take these monsters down! /i> Bring the kid who manipulates the mummy with his passive-aggressive serlfishness!  
"
23,5,Det. Harris,"Alright, men, let's take thee monsters out!
"
23,5,Shelly," No, just hold on a second! I'll take care of this. 
"
23,5,Randy,"Oh God, it's the cows we killed!
"
23,5,Pooh,"Oh. I'm really going to enjoy eating your brains. 
"
23,5,Randy,"Get 'im off of me! Get 'im off of me! Oh my God! Get 'im off of me!  Waugh! Get 'im off of me!
"
23,5,Both,"Help! Somebody help us! Get them off of me! Waugh! 
"
23,5,Both,"Somebody help us!
"
23,5,Towelie,"Somebody help us!
"
23,5,Randy,"Get 'im off of me! Augh! We gotta fight them, Towelie!
"
23,5,Towelie,"Help! somebody help us!
"
23,5,Randy,"Waugh!
"
23,5,Towelie,"I wanna live! Get them of of me! Help! sombody help us!
"
23,5,Randy,"We're going to live! We're going to live!  Help! Waugh, get him off of me! Get him off of me! You monsters! Go back to hell!  There's too many of 'em!  Oh! What is, What is that?!  Oh! No! 
"
23,5,Det. Harris,"Alright, that's it everyone! Nothin' to see here. Just some people who are really, really high.
"
23,5,Officers," Aawwwwwwww.
"
23,5,Officer Stevens,"I can't shoot anyone?
"
23,5,Det. Harris," You were so convinced the mummy was to blame for everything, weren't you? So convinced you made us all believe it too.
"
23,5,Butters,"I'm...  I'm sorry?
"
23,5,Det. Harris,"Yeah, well it's not us ...you really need to be sorry to.  Let's see if you even have a shred of decency to apologize when something is clearly your fault. 
"
23,5,Butters,"I'm so sorry. You're right. I can be selfish and narcissistic. Ah I'm gonna work on myself and... and try to make this curse work somehow. 
"
23,5,Officer Brown," It says, ""I hope you can get the help you need. I can't fix you""
"
23,5,Randy,"Hey, guess I slept in late, huh? What time is it? 
"
23,5,Sharon,"It's 8:15 am. November 3rd.
"
23,5,Randy,"Ooof, wow. That was some strong-ass Halloween Special, y'all. I mean... I saw rapists in the hot tub, zombie cows. I thought I was gonna die, and then, this fat, bitchy angel came and put me to bed.  Did everyone enjoy the Halloween Special?
"
23,5,Sharon,"No, Randy. Only you did.
"
23,5,Randy,"Oh. Well, that was pretty much my target audience anyway.  Hey, at least I really didn't have butt sex with Harvey Weinstein, huh?  Oh  Or did I?  Woo! Happy Halloween, everybody! 
"
23,6,Randy,"Hey, good morning, everybody. Welcome to Tegridy Breakfast, the show where we talk about everything Tegridy Farms. I'm Randy Marsh.
"
23,6,Towelie,"Hehehey, folks. I'm Towelie.
"
23,6,Randy,"Today we're gonna talk about what's been growing on the farm, especially our new Tegridy Thanksgiving Special. 
"
23,6,Towelie,"I'll tell you what. I-I, I smoked that out of a four-foot bong, and it just about destroyed my fro-
"
23,6,Agent," Alright, wrap it up! Shut this down! Come on, Marsh, Let's go.
"
23,6,Randy,"Guh, uh go where?
"
23,6,Agent,"Everyone's had enough, Mr. Marsh. I'm gonna need you to come with us. 
"
23,6,Randy," What the hell are you do-?  Sorry, everybody. We'll be right back.
"
23,6,Officer 1,"Let's go!
"
23,6,Randy,"What do you think you're-? My show! My Tegridy Farms show!
"
23,6,Randy,"Hello, Mayor. Mr. and Mrs. Tweek, ... Mackey.
"
23,6,Mayor McDaniels,"Mr. Marsh, do you remember a few weeks ago when homes in South Park were attacked by a terrorist called Mexican Joker?
"
23,6,Randy,"Yah, Mexican Joker. That was terrible.
"
23,6,Mayor,"Right. Except there was no Mexican Joker. It was you who blew up people's yards because they were home-growing their own marijuana.
"
23,6,Randy," Well, that's ridiculous.
"
23,6,Mayor,"The Tweeks have come forward with some footage caught on their security camera.
"
23,6,Randy,"Guys, I have nothing against homegrowers.
"
23,6,Mayor,"Run the footage, please! 
"
23,6,Randy,"Hm...  Hmmm... 
"
23,6,Mayor,"People are fed up, Marsh. The past few weeks you've held parades for yourself, needlessly slaughtered a thousand cows, made deals with the Chinese, and nearly poisoned everyone with your Halloween Special. Everyone's had enough of Tegridy Farms.
"
23,6,Randy,"Enough of Tegridy Farms? South Park is NOTHING without Tegridy Farms!
"
23,6,Mayor,"You'll be taken to county jail to await your trial. Get him out of here. 
"
23,6,Randy,"I didn't do anything wrong!  You people are just jealous! Jealous that I took over South Park and I'm successful! 
"
23,6,Mayor,"Well. At least now South Park can start getting back to normal.
"
23,6,Cartman,"Titty farts! Titty farts dog wiener.  Dog wiener, dog wiener!  Pubic mound. Pubic mound. 
"
23,6,Kyle,"Just hike the stupid ball, Cartman.
"
23,6,Cartman,"Pubic mound titty farts hike! 
"
23,6,Kyle,"Mississippi one Mississippi two Mississippi three Mississippi four Mississippi five Mississippi six Mississippi seven Mississippi eight Mississippi nine Mississippi ten Mississippi eleven Mississippi twelve Mississippi thirteen Mississippi fourteen Mississippi fifteen Mississippi.
"
23,6,Jason," Dude, I'm open!
"
23,6,Cartman," You can't catch!
"
23,6,Jason," Dude, I'm wide open! 
"
23,6,Cartman,"That totally would have been a touchdown.
"
23,6,Fr. Maxi,"Little Jason White was a happy child. A playful child. And ultimately it was his playfulness in sports that got him killed in a freak hit-and-run accident. The father would like to now say a few words. 
"
23,6,Bob,"I'm Robert White, Jason's father, and I can tell you that as a White, Jason lived a challenged life. When I look out on this congregation, I can't help but think, ""There's not a whole lot of people here."" Doesn't seem like a big deal. Nobody's outraged. 'Cause it was our family. Nobody cares when a White gets killed by the police. There should be protests and marches, but NO. The police killed a White! That's not protest-worthy! Everybody's busy trying to lock up Randy Marsh! Now my wife and I have a dead child and we can't even get any weed to make us feel better! Yeah, don't listen to me. I'm just a White. 
"
23,6,Sharon,"Kids, I have something to tell you, but I don't want you to be scared, okay? Daddy is... in police custody until there's a hearing. He could be in jail for a long time.
"
23,6,Shelly,"Do you promise?
"
23,6,Stan,"Like, how long is ""a long time""? Could it be years?
"
23,6,Sharon,"It could be, sweetheart. We don't know.
"
23,6,Stan,"YES!
"
23,6,Shelly,"Is it possible he could get out of it?
"
23,6,Sharon,"Of course it's possible, honey
"
23,6,Shelly,"Egh! 
"
23,6,Stan,"But if he doesn't get out of it, then what happens to us?
"
23,6,Sharon,"We probably have to sell the farm and move, back to town, and, sort of, live our lives without the marijuana business and without Daddy.  Just... try to stay hopeful, kids.
"
23,6,Stan,"We will, Mom. You too.
"
23,6,Sharon,"Okay, you too, Shelly.
"
23,6,Shelly,"Okay, Mom. You too.
"
23,6,Garrison,"What? ...Who? ...Oh okay, sure, put him through. This is the President.
"
23,6,Randy,"Hi, Mr. Ga- Mr. President, Uh, I'm really sorry to bother you. Look, uh... I'm in a bit of trouble.
"
23,6,Garrison,"Huho, tell me about it.
"
23,6,Randy,"Yeah, they uh, someone got some supposed evidence on me doing something... ""illegal"" and uh.
"
23,6,Garrison,"Well, did you tell everyone you didn't do anything wrong?
"
23,6,Randy,"Y-yeah, of course.
"
23,6,Garrison,"Well, did you then go on the attack and swap the accusations to make yourself a victim?
"
23,6,Randy,"Did I what?
"
23,6,Garrison,"Oh Jeez, DARVO, Randy. Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender. Alright, let's role-play. You be your accusers and I be you. Okay, go.
"
23,6,Randy,"Uh, uhm, ""Hey, you! You blew up people's yards who were growing their own marijuana!""
"
23,6,Garrison,"""No I didn't! Are you joking, you psychopath?! Now you're blowin' up my yard!"" Go ahead, try another one.
"
23,6,Randy,"""You, you illegally damaged property and made your business-""
"
23,6,Garrison,"""You damage property to make your business more profitable, you lying sack of shit! I'm not gonna be bullied by you!"" See?  It's really not that hard, just takes a little chin wiggle.
"
23,6,Randy,"Jeez, you're really good at that. Look, what I really need from you is some personnel. Do you know any good lawyers?
"
23,6,Garrison,"Do I know any good lawyers? No, but I do know Rudy Giuliani. 
"
23,6,Giuliani,"Hehey hey, fuck you!
"
23,6,Garrison,"The fuck you, Rudy. Are you finished cleaning up those pistachio nuts yet?
"
23,6,Giuliani,"Yeah, that's all of them, Mr. President.
"
23,6,Garrison,"Listen, Randy, I'm gonna throw you a bone. You just sit tight and I'll have him take care of this.
"
23,6,Sharon,"Sheila, Gerald, hi.
"
23,6,Sheila,"Hi, Sharon. We just know you're going through a really hard time right now. We wanted to bring you guys some lasagna.
"
23,6,Sharon,"Oh that's so sweet, thank you. Other families have brought some stuff too. Come on in.  Hey guys. We got lasagna. 
"
23,6,Shelly,"I love lasagnaaa.
"
23,6,Sharon,"No running in the house, you little turkeys. 
"
23,6,Sheila,"Oh, look at that, Sharon. You took down all the pictures of marijuana.
"
23,6,Sharon,"Oh, yeah. You know, just too painful. You know, they remind me of Randy. That's why I took Randy's pictures as well, because, you know, they remind me of Randy.
"
23,6,Linda Black,"Look, I'm sorry if you don't want to talk about it, but have you thought of what you guys might do if Randy gets put away?
"
23,6,Sharon,"Yeah, I've kind of made a list of all the things I might do. It's kind of a long list.
"
23,6,Bob,"Oh, isn't this lovely?  The whole town, turning out to support the Marsh family in their time of need.  Our son was killed by the police.
"
23,6,Mrs. White," Why?
"
23,6,Bob,"Would have been nice if somebody had brought us some lasagna. You know, if I'm not mistaken, it almost seems like you people are happy that Tegridy Farms is being indicted. It's almost like you're reveling in it. My wife and I were both Tegridy Plus members! We always believed in Randy Marsh. We believed... in Tegridy. And now there's less Whites. Now there's less Whites. 
"
23,6,Butters,"Oh Jeez. We should have never played football that close to the road.
"
23,6,Cartman,"Yeah, this isn't right.
"
23,6,Butters,"Wu-where are you going, Eric?
"
23,6,Cartman,"I think I might be able to help them. 
"
23,6,Cartman,"Mr. and Mrs. White!  I'm sorry about what happened. I knew Jason pretty well. He was a shitty receiver, but he would have wanted his parents to... move on. And help a new child.
"
23,6,Mrs. White,"What? What do you mean?
"
23,6,Cartman,"A few weeks ago, I was sent somewhere. It was a place where people like you could find a way to fill that empty hole.
"
23,6,Jeff,"Welcome, everyone. My name is Jeff. We're thrilled you've come to help out and adopt. The parents of the children inside have all been deported, but the kids are legal citizens, since they were born in the United States.  Mr. and Mrs. White?
"
23,6,Bob,"Yes?
"
23,6,Jeff,"We've all heard about your tragic loss. I'd love to help out however I can. Is there something specific you're looking for?
"
23,6,Mrs. White,"We... don't really know.
"
23,6,Jeff,"Well, we've got all kinds here, depending on your preferences.  Here's a little Panamanian. They're very clean. This is a Colombian shorthair. Oh, and this is a good one. This is a Baja shepherd.
"
23,6,Baja Shepherd,"Quiero a mi papá. Quiero a mi mamá. 
"
23,6,Jeff,"Bien, gracias. ¿Y tú? 
"
23,6,Bob,"Oh, honey. Look at the Peruvian hairless.
"
23,6,Jeff,"Yes, they're pretty silly-looking. Great with kids though.
"
23,6,Bob,"Hey, what's this little guy?
"
23,6,Jeff,"Oh, why, this is a purebred Mexican. He's had all his shots; parents were deported two weeks ago. Here, we can let him run around a little bit. 
"
23,6,Mexican," Mi familia. ¿Dónde está? 
"
23,6,Jeff,"Bien, gracias. ¿Y tú? 
"
23,6,Mrs. White,"Oh Bob, he's kind of perfect.
"
23,6,Bob,"Hello, little fellow. How would you like to be a White? 
"
23,6,Randy,"Look, doctor. You have to give me something. I'm really sick.
"
23,6,Doctor,"What exactly are your symptoms?
"
23,6,Randy,"I'm like, starting to question things that I've done. Like, starting to question the person I've become. And I can't sleep at night I, I just lay in my cell wondering if I've been a bad father lately, and a bad husband, and... please, it really hurts. I need some marijuana.
"
23,6,Doctor,"Sounds like you haven't had access to marijuana for a while, now reality is setting in.
"
23,6,Randy,"I just need a little medicinal weed and these symptoms will all go away.
"
23,6,Doctor,"Well maybe they shouldn't go away. Maybe this is your wake-up call that you've been abusing drugs, and need to face all your wrongdoings, try to turn your life around.
"
23,6,Randy,"You need to turn your life around! Clearly you have the addiction problem and I'm just your whipping boy!
"
23,6,Doctor,"That's not going to work, Mr. Marsh. You're not the President of the United States.
"
23,6,Randy,"Ahh, poop!
"
23,6,Mrs. White,"Well Alejandro, how are you enjoying being a White so far?
"
23,6,Alejandro,"Mi familia. ¿Dónde está? 
"
23,6,Mrs. White,"Bien, gracias. ¿Y tú? 
"
23,6,Bob,"Yes, it's good us Whites have each other, Alejandro, because... I need to tell you something. You see, now that you're a White, life isn't gonna be so easy. You're gonna find that a lot of people in this world just don't care about the Whites.
"
23,6,Mrs. White,"You'll hear about how others in the world are mistreated, but nobody will care when you are.
"
23,6,Crystal,"Being a White is the hardest thing ever.
"
23,6,Bob,"That's my little White.  Oh, turn it up, honey.
"
23,6,Anchor,"And the President of the United States today called the allegations against Randy Marsh ""total, buttfucking bullshit,"" and claims the neighbors who came forward with the evidence video are ""tampon-faced, 69ing whistleblowers."" When asked for clarification, the President's lawyer and treasonous pig Rudy Giuliani, had this to say.
"
23,6,Giuliani,"Ohhh, this is just a conspiracy. It's conspiracy! And we need everyone out there who, who don't think their voices are heard, to make their voices louder!
"
23,6,Bob,"Uh, he's absolutely right. Starting tomorrow, the Whites are gonna start actively trying to stop all this trial nonsense.
"
23,6,Mrs. White,"Bob, Alejandro's on your phone and it's past phone use time.
"
23,6,Bob,"Hey!  Why, he's trying to call Mexico! Alejandro, the Whites do not use mobile devices after 7 pm.
"
23,6,Mrs. White,"Why would he try to call long distance to Mexico? Does he just assume that the Whites have all the money in the world?
"
23,6,Bob,"The Whites don't call long distance! 
"
23,6,Mrs. White,"Jason never tried to use mobile devices after the cutoff time. Jason never tried to call long distance. 
"
23,6,Bob,"Well good job, Alejandro! Now you've upset your mother!
"
23,6,Alejandro,"¡Esa no es mi madre! 
"
23,6,Bob,"Bien, gracias. ¿Y tú? 
"
23,6,Randy,"I've had a lot of time to just sit in here and think. I'm starting to realize I have this pattern of behavior where I... always want more. More weed, more drinks, more deals with the Chinese. It's never enough. See, I've always had my flaws, but at the end of the day, I cared about people. You know what the President said? He said just deny everything and make yourself the victim. Yeah, well... maybe he's part of how I got here. Maybe the President has brought down my moral meter. I don't mean to cast blame - I'm to blame - but... ever since he was elected, I've compared my morals to his. And no matter how awful I am, I'm never as bad a the President, so I'm... okay.
"
23,6,Bob,"Help support Tegridy Farms and Randy Marsh! Randy Marsh has done nothing wrong! Stop the ridiculous persecution! 
"
23,6,Mrs. White,"Exonerate Tegridy Farms?  Oh yeah! Just ignore us! The Whites are used to it!
"
23,6,Bob,"Good one, honey.
"
23,6,Crystal,"Daddy! Alejandro isn't ringing his bell!
"
23,6,Bob,"Alejandro! There's few enough of us as it is! We're not gonna stop this trial unless all the Whites chip in!  Now ring your bell! 
"
23,6,Alejandro," ¡No quiero estar aquí! 
"
23,6,Mrs. White,"It's like he doesn't appreciate us, Bob.
"
23,6,Bob,"Oh, I know.
"
23,6,Mrs. White,"I mean, we give him a place to live, food, we take care of him.
"
23,6,Bob,"It just...  he just doesn't seem happy. Maybe if we got him a little thing to take care of and feed he'd understand how much responsibility it is.
"
23,6,Jeff,"We're so glad you came back, Mr. and Mrs. White. We have even more kids now whose parents have been deported.
"
23,6,Bob,"See one you like, Alejandro? Now that you're a White, you can pick anyone you want.
"
23,6,Jeff,"Oh, here's a good one. Four years old, parents just deported yesterday. He's a Panamanian podengo pequeño.
"
23,6,Bob,"Do you like him, Alejandro?
"
23,6,Jeff,"We could see how he gets along with the kids. 
"
23,6,Panamanian,"Quiero a mi mamá. 
"
23,6,Alejandro,"Nunca la vas a ver. 
"
23,6,Mrs. White,"Oh look. I think he likes him.
"
23,6,Bob,"Alright, Alejandro, but you have to take care of him and clean up after him.
"
23,6,Mrs. White,"This is a great addition to our family.
"
23,6,Bob,"Yeah.  Now there will be more Whites to stop those needless hearings.
"
23,6,Officer Peterson,"Hey Marsh, you got a visitor.
"
23,6,Randy,"I do?
"
23,6,Officer Peterson," Fifteen minutes. That's all you get. 
"
23,6,Giuliani,"Hello Mr. Marsh? My name is Mr. Giuliani. I've been sent to try and help you.
"
23,6,Randy,"Oh. Thanks, but I think I'm just gonna plead guilty.
"
23,6,Giuliani,"Oh, that sounds like someone who's a little down in the puss. The President said you would be, and he thought you might need a little something special.  Ssshhhhhh.  Would this make you feel better?
"
23,6,Randy,"Oh. Ohhh.
"
23,6,Giuliani," Is this just what the doctor ordered?
"
23,6,Randy,"Yeahhh. 
"
23,6,Field reporter,"Tom, I'm standing outside the government building where Randy Marsh is about to be arraigned. Protesters from both sides have gathered here. Some of them who are for the proceedings...
"
23,6,Crowd,"Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up!
"
23,6,Field reporter,"...and also those in support of ending the investigation.
"
23,6,The Whites,"Let him go! Let him go!
"
23,6,Mrs. White,"These hearings are a waste of the taxpayers' money!
"
23,6,Bob,"Nothing in these hearings will change the Whites' minds one bit!
"
23,6,Crystal,"Daddy!
"
23,6,Bob,"What?
"
23,6,Crystal,"Alejandro isn't putting on his sunscreen! 
"
23,6,Bob,"Alejandro, what have we told you?! All Whites wear sunscreen! Put it on right now! 
"
23,6,Alejandro,"¡Ahhh! ¡No necesito protector solar! ¡Necesito a mi madre y a mi padre! 
"
23,6,Bob,"¡BIEN, GRACIAS! ¡¿Y TÚ?!  Now put it on! 
"
23,6,Alejandro,"¡Alto! ¡Aah! ¡Alto! ¡Te odio! ¡Te odio! 
"
23,6,Mayor,"In the South Park vs. Tegridy Farms matter, we are now ready to proceed with the arraignment. Before doing so, Mr. Marsh, do you have any words?
"
23,6,Randy,"Yeah, I have some words to say!
"
23,6,Giuliani,"Go get 'em! Go, go get 'em!
"
23,6,Randy,"I can't believe I'm being attacked here! You people are monsters! The evidence shows me in a yard taking a dump! Yes! Because I was setting a trap for Mexican Joker!  That's right! And Mexican Joker attacked seconds later! I was trying to protect you people from terrorists! And what do I get for it?! I get a- a bunch of-  A bunch of... No... No, I can't do this. You wanna know what really happened? The President... sent me his lawyer, and his lawyer told me what to say to get off and gave me a joint in prison.
"
23,6,Crowd," What??
"
23,6,Randy,"And then I smoked that joint! And you know what I thought?! I thought ""this is some shitty-ass weed."" It wasn't Tegridy. It barely even changed my mental state. The reason I got into the marijuana business was to make quality, simple weed that came from the heart. Weed that was strong, and pure. Somewhere on that journey I lost my way. Tegridy weed is about community. It's a sunrise. It's the smile on a baby. But most of all , Tegridy weed is about family. I had forgotten I have a loving wife, and son , and I'm not gonna forget them anymore.  So I'm not gonna fight this. I'll do my time and... maybe someday I'll be back. Making marijuana that's simple. Marijuana that's Tegridy. Because, when you do the right thing, good things happen. 
"
23,6,Man with orange shirt,"It's him! Oh god, it's him!
"
23,6,Townswoman,"Oh, Jesus, save us!
"
23,6,Officer 2,"G-give it up, Mexican Joker. You don't wanna do this. 
"
23,6,Bob,"Alejandro! Get down from there this minute!
"
23,6,Alejandro,"¡Abajo con Estados Unidos! 
"
23,6,Reporters,"Mr. Marsh. Mr. Marsh. Mr. Marsh Marsh Marsh. Over here.
"
23,6,Reporter,"Mr. Marsh, how does it feel to be exonerated? 
"
23,6,Randy,"Thank you. It feels really good to have these charges dropped. Now we can all get back to the business of trying to heal. I'd like to...  Would you please get the fuck away from me?  I'd like to take this opportunity to thank those who have always been by my side, supporting me from the very beginning, the people who stood by me since day one and gave me hope. The Whites.  Thanks for having my back, Mr. and Mrs. White. And now, everybody, if you don't mind, I've got a farm to tend to. 
"
23,6,Randy,"Well gang, I guess that's about it, huh? It's been a really good run, but, looks like the season is over.
"
23,6,Shelly," The season is over?
"
23,6,Randy,"Well sure, the first snow is falling, crops are pretty much dead. Well what'd you all think, huh? I think the season was a little better than anyone expected. I really wanna thank you guys for a great run.  And hey, we hope you all enjoyed the season too. It had a little bit of everything, didn't it? And hopefully, the season finale really brought it all home. Of course, if you haven't had a chance to try the season finale yet, it is available now for a special price. This limited-edition weed made from the very last crop of the season is pricey, but worth it. 
"
23,6,Announcer,"Now taking pre-orders for Season 2.
"
23,7,PC Girl,"Now back to PC Babies.
"
23,7,PC Boy,"Waaa! 
"
23,7,PC Principal,"Yeah! Who's strong?
"
23,7,Strong Woman,"I'm strong!
"
23,7,PC Principal,"Who's Strong Woman?
"
23,7,Strong Woman,"I'm Strong Woman! 
"
23,7,PC Principal,"You're gonna smoke the competition!
"
23,7,Strong Woman,"I'm gonna smoke the competition!  Oh no. It's the babies.
"
23,7,PC Principal,"Kids, kids. Okay, what the matter?
"
23,7,Strong Woman,"Oh, no! I left Disney+ on and it went to Mulan.
"
23,7,PC Principal,"They don't like Mulan?
"
23,7,Strong Woman,"No, because Mulan is a female that identifies as male and yet the movie doesn't take the time to address real trans issues.
"
23,7,PC Principal,"Okay, okay, we know!  Mulan is outdated in creating straw dog characters to talk about trans issues! Daddy's turning it off! 
"
23,7,Anderson Cooper,"-But just how many advocates have yet to be seen? 
"
23,7,PC Principal,"Alright everybody, listen up! As you know, this school is a place where everyone should feel included. Our challenge is to motivate ourselves and others to create an inviting, non-negative and HEY STOTCH, YOU GOT A FUCKING PROBLEM?! 
"
23,7,Butters," No sir!
"
23,7,PC Principal,"Now I think that what we all need are leaders who motivate by example, and so I would like to inform you all that your vice-principal  is competing in the Strong Woman Competition in Morrison this weekend. Let's hear it for her. 
"
23,7,Strong Woman,"Well, thank you PC Principal. Um, listen, guys. I just hope I can make you proud, and more importantly, I hope you can see that no matter who you are, you can do anything. We've really come a long way breaking down gender-binary bigotry, and I hope I can especially inspire some of my girl students here.
"
23,7,PC Principal,"Or those who identify as girls.
"
23,7,Strong Woman,"Yes, or those who identify as girls. Get out there and get involved in school sports and clubs. If there's something you love, don't ever let anything hold you back.
"
23,7,Cartman,"The first bugbear lashes out at Stan with its broadsword.  And it hits with a 17.
"
23,7,Stan,"How much damage is that?
"
23,7,Cartman,"4 + 2 slashing
"
23,7,Butters,"Okay. I jump up to the bugbear! And I yell ""FOR WATERDEEP!"" and I kick it in the balls!
"
23,7,Cartman,"I don't think bugbears have balls.
"
23,7,Clyde,"Then how do they make baby bugbears? 
"
23,7,Mr. Mackey,"Oh hi, boys. Uh we got some new students who want to be part of the gaming club. You know Tammy and Nichole.
"
23,7,Cartman,"Ah huh, ah, heh heh neh no.
"
23,7,Mr. Mackey,"This is a school club, boys. All clubs are inclusive. Have fun, girls. 
"
23,7,Nichole,"Hey guys. 
"
23,7,Scott," What the fuck do we do?
"
23,7,Cartman,"Um, guys, we play lots of games here at Dice Studz, but today  we're playing D&D. You don't just show up and start playing, you have to generate characters and-
"
23,7,Tammy,"Yeah, we created some this morning. I'm a human paladin and Nichole is a Tiefling warlock. 
"
23,7,Clyde," Do something, Eric!
"
23,7,Cartman,"Eheh, ha, guys, um, they're fighting a bunch of bugbears now that are led by a 12th level druid...
"
23,7,Nichole,"Okay, I cast Vampiric Touch on the druid.  Crit. 
"
23,7,David,"A beautiful morning in Morrison, Colorado as we get ready for the 6th Annual Strong Woman Competition, a two-day long competition of tests built to push athletes to their very limits.  Joining me now is the current champion of the Strong Woman Competition, Strong Woman.  Ms. Woman, do you feel ready? 
"
23,7,Strong Woman,"Oh yeah. I'm ready, David. There are just so many amazing women athletes out here today it makes me so proud.
"
23,7,David,"Now, this is the first year that a trans woman is in the competition. How do you feel about that?
"
23,7,Strong Woman,"Amazing. I feel honored to be a part of history. I have a lot of incredible trans friends who are athletes, and so we're all inspired this woman is competing.
"
23,7,David,"Uh huh, and uh have you ever actually met Heather Swanson?
"
23,7,Strong Woman,"Uh, no, I've never competed against her before, no.
"
23,7,David,"She's not exactly your average trans athlete.
"
23,7,Strong Woman,"Well, what is an ""average trans athlete""? Honestly, I find that kind of bigoted, David.
"
23,7,David,"Okay, Heather Swanson is actually joining us now. Ms. Swanson, how does it feel to be competing today? 
"
23,7,Heather," I can't tell you how free I feel now that I've started identifying as a woman.  Now that I can compete as female, I'm ready to smash the other girls.
"
23,7,David,"And is it correct you just started identifying as female two weeks ago?
"
23,7,Heather,"I'm not here to talk about my transition! I'm here to kick some fuckin' ass! Let me tell you something, dingleberry!
"
23,7,David,"David Perry!
"
23,7,Heather,"I'm gonna roll up the other women here, and I'm gonna smoke 'em! I am the strongest woman this state has ever seen! 
"
23,7,David,"Any words for the challenger, Ms. Woman?
"
23,7,Strong Woman,"Uh, good luck, Heather.
"
23,7,Heather,"Huh huh, luck is for dudes. 
"
23,7,David,"Well, with that let's get right to the action.
"
23,7,Heather," Arrrgh-yeahhhh!  Hell yeah! I won! I'm a strong woman! Look at it! It's mine! I'm the best! I'm the strongest!
"
23,7,PC Principal,"So, second place. That's pretty damn good.
"
23,7,Strong Woman,"Yeah...
"
23,7,PC Principal,"I guess she... just started identifying as a woman a few weeks ago. Doesn't really seem.., fair...
"
23,7,Strong Woman,"Just don't! You'll upset the PC babies.
"
23,7,Cartman," It is unfair, it is tyrannous, and it is wrong! Ever since these girls were allowed to join Dice Studz Gamers Club, it has been a train wreck! Every single game, they like, figure out all the rules, and they, use the rules, to like, make us look stupid!
"
23,7,Butters,"In D&D they killed the dungeon master.  Well we didn't even think it was possible to kill the dungeon master.
"
23,7,Cartman,"Shut up, Butters. It's not possible. It's just that we play board games for the themes. We want to be pirates, or Vikings. You know what the girls think about? They think about red cubes versus blue cubes, and how much of this equals how many victory points. They're just doing math.
"
23,7,Mr. Mackey,"So they're smarter than you and beating you at all the board games.
"
23,7,Scott,"Yeth.
"
23,7,Cartman,"NO!
"
23,7,Scott," NO!
"
23,7,Cartman,"It's it's just, different.  Look, we started Dice Studz with a dream. A dream that we could actually do something interesting at school, just for like 60 minutes. 
"
23,7,Cartman,"""Nothing we can do,"" he said. ""Hands are tied,"" he said. We're gonna have to deal with this ourselves, you guys.
"
23,7,Stan,"I think Nichole and Tammy are cool to play with.
"
23,7,Cartman,"Well you won't think they're cool when the rest of us leave Dice Studz and you're left to play only solo board games!
"
23,7,Stan,"You mean like Nemo's War? Nemo's War is sweet.
"
23,7,Clyde,"Look, maybe we just gotta play harder stuff, you know? Stuff the girls can't keep up with.
"
23,7,Butters,"Hey, that's not a bad idea. We've been taking it easy on the girls. Time to show 'em what real board gamers play.
"
23,7,Scott,"What do real board gamers play?
"
23,7,Stan,"Well if you want something hard, then you need a really crunchy Euro game, something like a Vital Lacerda's Escape Plan or a Uwe Rosenburg Euro.
"
23,7,Cartman,"Do they involve math?
"
23,7,Stan,"Well all Euros are pretty mathy.
"
23,7,Cartman,"Nope, no good. We need something with lots of, like WAR and DICE and THEMATIC shit.
"
23,7,Stan,"So then you want a war miniatures game. Something skirmish-style, like Legion or Blood and Plunder.
"
23,7,Kyle,"Dude, you're really into board games.
"
23,7,Cartman,"Alright, that's it, you guys. Dice Studz Gamers Club is about to go  tabletop miniatures.
"
23,7,Strong Woman,"Emory, stop playing with your food. 
"
23,7,PC Principal,"I'll get it. 
"
23,7,Heather,"Hey, what's going on? Is your girlfriend home?
"
23,7,PC Principal,"Uh, she's sort of busy right now, Ms. Swanson.
"
23,7,Heather,"Just wanna tell her no hard feelings about me winning the Strong Woman competition. 
"
23,7,PC Principal,"Yeah, you already told her that at the competition.
"
23,7,Heather,"You got a problem with me? 'Cause it's starting to seem like you have a problem with me!
"
23,7,Strong Woman,"What's going on-? Oh, hi Heather.
"
23,7,Heather,"I was just stopping by to make sure you're not too beat up.
"
23,7,Strong Woman,"Oh, that's... really cool. I'm sorry, but I have all the kids right now, and they're-
"
23,7,Heather,"Oh, where are the little kiddos?  I'd love to meet 'em.  Oho hey kids. Whoa, there's a lot of you. Your mom must be a strong woman to take care of all o'you. Of course, I have the Strong Woman trophy though. Heheheheh. Just kidding, right?
"
23,7,PC Principal,"Look, why don't you just get out of here?!
"
23,7,Heather,"Oh! Sounds like someone here is a transphobe.
"
23,7,PC Principal,"Don't you dare! I'm trans people's biggest supporter! What I think you are is a terrible sport!
"
23,7,Heather,"Transphobe.
"
23,7,PC Principal,"You'd better knock it off!
"
23,7,Strong Woman,"Just don't. You're gonna upset the PC babies.
"
23,7,PC Principal,"And if you dare call me transphobe again, I'm gonna-
"
23,7,Heather,"You're gonna what? Beat me up? You're gonna beat me up, transphobe?  Yeah, I didn't think so. See you later, kids. Come on over and see old Auntie Heather if you want to see what a REAL strong woman is like. 
"
23,7,PC Principal,"Are you feeling what I'm feeling?
"
23,7,Strong Woman,"What do you mean?
"
23,7,PC Principal,"I don't know what it is, but... something about that woman just doesn't seem right.
"
23,7,Emory,"Now back to PC Babies.
"
23,7,Nichole,"Hey guys. Hope it's cool we brought Kelly. She wants to be in the club too.
"
23,7,Cartman," Oho yes! that's very cool, girls! We're just setting up today's game. It's a pirate miniatures game called Blood & Plunder. 
"
23,7,Nichole,"Yeah, we saw it on the schedule.
"
23,7,Tammy,"We love Blood And Plunder. Are we gonna play like a four-on-four skirmish with two different factions? 
"
23,7,Stan,"Whoa, you painted your miniatures?
"
23,7,Tammy,"Yeah. Who wants unpainted miniatures, right? 
"
23,7,Stan,"Where'd you learn to do that?
"
23,7,Nichole,"We watch YouTube tutorials. You can find a much on BGG.
"
23,7,Stan,"I love BGG.
"
23,7,Kelly,"Oh cool. Do you watch Game Night?
"
23,7,Cartman,"Excuse me!  We're going to play the six-hour long, very thematic Nemesis!
"
23,7,Nichole,"Oh cool. We just watched the tutorial for that on Dice Tower. 
"
23,7,Announcer,"And now, back to Women In Sports, with Janet Spears.
"
23,7,Janet,"Our next guest has been really lighting it up in women's competitions. Since she's identified as female two weeks ago, she's won every female sport she's entered. Please welcome Heather Swanson. 
"
23,7,Heather,"Well thank you, Janet. It's a great pleasure to be here. I know that I'm an inspiration to all women and trans athletes everywhere.
"
23,7,Janet," Yes, we are all truly inspired.
"
23,7,Heather,"Now there are some women out there who just want to run and hide.  I'm talkin' to you, Strong Woman!  You still dare call yourself that?! Your name is a joke, because ol' Heather Swanson here will beat you anywhere, anytime, at anything! 
"
23,7,PC Principal,"Hey, don't let her get to you, Strong.
"
23,7,Strong Woman,"She's not getting to me.
"
23,7,PC Principal,"I, I-I don't know why she has such a grudge against you, and I-
"
23,7,Strong Woman,"Because I know her.
"
23,7,PC Principal," What do you mean?
"
23,7,Strong Woman,"It's Blade Jaggart. He - she - is my ex-boyfriend.
"
23,7,PC Principal,"... What?
"
23,7,Strong Woman,"Back when we were together he was such an asshole. When I finally broke up with him, he said one day he was going to get me back. And now he's got us both by the balls.
"
23,7,PC Principal,"But then... she doesn't really care about trans people? Or women?
"
23,7,Strong Woman,"He hates wome- she, hates women. When I left him, he felt he got beat by a girl, and nothing makes Blade Jaggart more crazy than getting beat by a girl.
"
23,7,PC Principal,"I didn't even know people like that existed.
"
23,7,Cartman," It is unfair. It is tyrannous, and it is wrong. Dice Studz is a board game group that brings thrills and laughter to dozens of boys at our school. But that laughter is being turned into screams as girls constantly invade with their unfairness.
"
23,7,Butters," The girls found Eric on the first round of Fury of Dracula! 
"
23,7,Cartman," Yes, inclusion is wonderful, but we have to admit that boys and girls are simply different in some ways that can sometimes make competitions unfair. Have you ever seen how girls do their homework? They do it... that night, meticulously going over every detail and often finishing before they absolutely have to. This is how girls are with board game rule books. Before we even start playing, they've already strategized a way to win, leaving others in the dust. And now I'd like for you to hear from my friend Scott, who has diabetes.
"
23,7,Scott," My name is Scott Malkinson and I have diabetes.
"
23,7,Cartman," Terminal diabetes.
"
23,7,Scott," I have terminal diabetes. Board games are the only thing that give me relief from the physical and mental anguish I experience every day.
"
23,7,Butters,"Wow, Scott. I didn't know it was that bad.
"
23,7,Scott,"Neither did I.  Dice Studz is my only shot at happiness. Please don't let outdated school policies destroy it. 
"
23,7,Cartman," Wow, thank you, Scott. Diabetes, everyone.  We hope that our presentation has helped to change your minds about school clubs in our country. If not, we will be back, every single day. Please, let Dice Studz be for studs.
"
23,7,MMA Host,"Womens' MMA fighting is growing in popularity, and no other female fighter is as explosive as Heather Swanson.
"
23,7,Heather,"Eee-yeahhh!
"
23,7,MMA Host,"Heather, your story is an inspiration to sports fans everywhere. Congratulation on your ""shocking"" success.
"
23,7,Heather,"I just hope I can motivate little girls out there. Motivate them to understand that I will beat them at any sport they try. Motivate them to run away like that chicken shit Strong Woman did because I-
"
23,7,PC Principal," Alright. Alright, that's enough. You uh, you made your point, Heather. We get it, okay?
"
23,7,Heather,"Oh hey, transphobe. This is a nice surprise.
"
23,7,Strong Woman,"Oh God, what is he doing?
"
23,7,PC Principal,"Look, everyone, I know we're all a little... afraid to have any opinions on this stuff, but um, there can be situations where it's... not so easy... to... what I mean is, I...
"
23,7,Heather,"I didn't count on being the best since identifying as a woman.
"
23,7,PC Principal,"Yeah, no shit, 'cause you went through puberty as a male, so your body's completely different! 
"
23,7,Heather,"And that's exactly what a transphobe would say!
"
23,7,PC Principal,"I told you not to call me a transphobe! All I want is to have a discussion.
"
23,7,Heather,"Transphobe! 
"
23,7,PC Principal,"Aw, shit.
"
23,7,Cartman,"Ahhh, isn't this nice, you guys? Clean, fresh air, soothing sounds, just us boys and Star Trek: Ascendancy.""
"
23,7,Butters," Uh hey, fellas! Come quick! You gotta see!
"
23,7,Clyde,"See what?
"
23,7,Butters,"Well, it's the girls! They started their own board game club at the school! 
"
23,7,Cartman,"""Board Girls""? How lame is that? 
"
23,7,Cartman,"The fuck is this?
"
23,7,Stan,"Wow!
"
23,7,Butters," Well this is like what you said Dice Studz would be, Eric.
"
23,7,Nichole," Oh, hey guys, welcome to Board Girls. Want to have a look around?  So over  here we have our co-op games.  I think they’re doing “Sub Terra” right now.  And there we do our deck and engine builders. Have you tried “Inuit”?  It’s really cool.  We have miniatures painting over there  and most of our miniatures gaming happens in  that area.
"
23,7,Clyde,"Hey, those girls are playing “Crisis Protocol”. That’s not even out yet.
"
23,7,Nichole,"Yeah, we get advanced copies of games because our club reviews them for our gaming channel. 
"
23,7,Mr. Mackey,"Hey boys, you need to get out, okay? No boys in the girls' school clubs. Come on, let's go.
"
23,7,Stan,"What? Who says?
"
23,7,Mr. Mackey,"New school policy came down from the top. Now get your asses outta there.
"
23,7,Stan,"Well, who made up that stupid rule?
"
23,7,Cartman,"... Yeah, who made up that stupid rule?
"
23,7,Emory,"We now return to PC Babies.
"
23,7,Strong Woman,"Are you just... not gonna come home?
"
23,7,Pete,"How am I gonna look my kids in the eyes, Strong? Since they were born, we've taught them to accept and fight for those who are marginalized. That there's no gray area when it comes to inclusion and acceptance. When I go back, all they're gonna see is a big, fat hypocrite. And now I've just used a word to shame people with weight issues. 
"
23,7,Strong Woman,"P, you can't just shut down because you're afraid of how the babies are gonna react.
"
23,7,Pete,"I didn't shove him - her - for being trans. I shoved her because she's your ex-boyfriend and she's being a dick. Do you think the PC babies will see the nuance?/But they're right, Strong. I shoved a trans person. No matter what, I have no right to judge her. Do you think- Could you try to explain it to the babies?
"
23,7,Strong Woman,"You know how they are. They're babies. Their minds are made up before anyone says anything.
"
23,7,Pete,"Then I've really got only one thing I can do. I have to try and make things right with Heather Swanson.
"
23,7,Strong Woman,"Uh, hey students. As you know, we've had some issues here at the school that we're working very hard to correct. So today we are... honored... to have a motivational speaker. She is the current Strong Woman competition, and also the champion in women's MMA fighting, and in women's wrestling. Please welcome the inspiring Heather Swanson.
"
23,7,Heather Swanson," Yeeaahhhh! Fuck yeeaahhhh! 
"
23,7,Heather,"Hello, boys and girls. I'm here to talk to you because apparently your school leaders have failed you. I'm gonna tell you something, kids. There's only one thing that matters in this world, and that's being the best. Your vice-principal teaches you girls to be strong, but she comes in second.  You got anything to say about that, PC Principal?
"
23,7,Pete,"No, Ms. Swanson.
"
23,7,Heather,"""No, Ms. Swanson.""  You see, people don't look up to losers. They look up to champions! Every time I beat another woman, I feel better
"
23,7,Cartman,"Dude, I really like this person.
"
23,7,Heather,"And that's why I'm the best. Because Heather Swanson doesn't get beat. I work to be the best at everything. And Heather Swanson will beat any other woman any time, anywhere!
"
23,7,Tammy,"Bet you can't beat Nichole at Blood Rage.
"
23,7,Heather,"What? Wha-what did you say, transphobe?
"
23,7,Nichole,"Yeah, but I bet you can't beat Tammy at War of the Ring.
"
23,7,Heather,"You don't disrespect a champion, little girls! You think Heather Swanson doesn't know board games?! I was playing board games before your mom even crapped you out of her vagina!
"
23,7,Nichole,"Okay, so then let's do it, bitch!
"
23,7,Heather,"Oh it's onnn!
"
23,7,Heather,"Do you think that's fair?! You only won 'cause you dumb girls memorized the rule books! When I play games, I just wanna be a pirate or a spaceman! 
"
23,7,Cartman,"That's right! You and your stupid rules!
"
23,7,Heather,"I may identify as a woman now, but I grew up a boy, so you have an unfair advantage over me!
"
23,7,Cartman,"Yeah, an unfair advantage, stupid girls! Come on, Ms. Swanson. We can go make our own club. 
"
23,7,Strong Woman," You sure you're ready for this?
"
23,7,Pete,"I just wanna get it over with. 
"
23,7,Babies,"Mommy! Yay!
"
23,7,Strong Woman,"Yes, kids, and look who else is here.
"
23,7,Babies," Daddy! Yeah Daddy! Dada!
"
23,7,Emory,"Dada. I love you.
"
23,7,Pete,"I... I don't understand.
"
23,7,Strong Woman,"They don't care. They must see the nuance to this whole situation.
"
23,7,Pete,"You're right! They realize that raising a gender-based issue of strength doesn't necessarily make one a bigot or a bully. All this time we were worried what the PC babies would think.
"
23,7,Strong Woman,"And we didn't realize that our little babies are growing up. 
"
23,8,Sheila,"When I look out across this room, I see the backbone of our community. The women of this town need to stand together.  We're here, and we're proud, and it is time to let everyone know that the women of South Park should be treated the same as the men!  Oh God!  Oh God!  Ohh, sorry. 
"
23,8,Mrs. Testaburger,"Ohoho-kay. 
"
23,8,Sheila,"I'm alright. Oh... 
"
23,8,Dr. Gauche,"Hello boys. Your mommy has a bacterial infection called C. diff. It's very contagious.
"
23,8,Kyle,"A bacterial infection? In her stomach?
"
23,8,Dr. Gauche," All of us have trillions of microscopic critters that grow on and inside our bodies. Just like your mom.  There's tiny creatures that live in your mom's skin, on her eyelashes, in her vagina. But the good bacteria in mommy's tummy are being overrun by bad bacteria. .  We can't use antibiotics, because that will kill all the good bacteria too. 
"
23,8,Kyle,"So what can you do for her?
"
23,8,Dr. Gauche,"We need to take a healthy person's microbiome and start to grow it inside your mother.  We do this with a fecal transplant. We'll get a donor's feces, mix it with water, and put it up your mom's anus. 
"
23,8,"Kyle, Ike","Eeewww!
"
23,8,Dr. Gauche,"Your mom is tough, kids. We're gonna do the very best we can, kids. Try not to worry. 
"
23,8,Kyle,"Ike, if Mom lives, we can't let anyone ever know about this.
"
23,8,Sheila,"
I am shopping. 
I'm grocery shopping. 
I'm buying food for the people I love!


"
23,8,Laura,"Sheila?
"
23,8,Sheila," Oh, hi Laura.
"
23,8,Laura,"My goodness, look at you. Ah, I thought you were sick.
"
23,8,Sheila,"I was! But I had an amazing procedure.
"
23,8,Ike," No no no no no no, Mommy, no no no no no no!
"
23,8,Sheila,"I had a fecal transplant.
"
23,8,Ike,"Oh, god damnit! 
"
23,8,Mrs. Biggle,"You had a what?
"
23,8,Sheila,"A fecal transplant. It's when they take the feces of a healthy donor and place it in your anus. I feel like a million dollars!
"
23,8,Linda S.," Sheila, is that you? I thought you were sick.
"
23,8,Sheila,"I was! But I had a fecal transplant.
"
23,8,Ike," Aaaaah!
"
23,8,Sheila,"I'm telling you girls, it's solved every problem I've ever had. I've lost weight, I have more energy, I even think my arthritis is clearing up. 
"
23,8,Laura,"Well, that certainly is... interesting.
"
23,8,Janice,"You're looking great, Sheila!
"
23,8,Sheila,"Thanks, Janice. Fecal transplant!
"
23,8,Narrator,"If you're watching this video, then your mom probably had a fecal transplant.  And the one question on your mind is most likely ""How do I keep my friends from ripping on me?"" 
"
23,8,Kyle,"Yes!
"
23,8,Narrator,"People make fun of what they don't understand.  So let's learn why your mom had a fecal transplant. It was to replace her  microbiome. Germs, bugs.  Thousands of organisms are all around you, all the time. That remote control you're holding.  It's teeming with life. Bacteria and other organisms.
"
23,8,Kyle,"Yuch. 
"
23,8,Narrator,"They also live on your clothes.
"
23,8,Kyle,"Yeesh.
"
23,8,Narrator,"Small organisms are everywhere. Now, scratch your balls.  Go on.  If you don't have balls, scratch whatever else might be down there.  Now, smell your fingers.  That smell is millions of living organisms that you just scraped from your crotch and are now going up into your nostrils.  Your microbiome.
"
23,8,Kyle,"Eewww!
"
23,8,Narrator,"Creatures live in your teeth. They live on your eyelashes. On your skin. And trillions and trillions live inside your body.  In fact, of all the cells in your body, only half are human cells . The other half are all microscopic organisms. 
"
23,8,Kyle,"Aaagh! 
"
23,8,Laura,"How was your salmon, Sheila?
"
23,8,Sheila,"Oh it's amazing. You know I could never eat like this before. My allergy to shellfish has literally gone away.
"
23,8,Linda S.,"Oh my gosh, that's so wonderful.
"
23,8,Mrs. Biggle,"Oh.  That, that reminds me, so, Sheila, um, the girls and I were talking. Well, you seem so... great, and we thought how nice it would be for us to have a little bit of your poop.
"
23,8,Sheila,"... Um, what?
"
23,8,Laura,"Well, thing is, we asked our doctors about getting fecal transplants too, and they said they only do them for ""medical reasons,"" so we have to do them on our own.
"
23,8,Sheila,"Oh heh, well, you know girls, if the doctor doesn't think it's safe, you probably shouldn't be doing DIY transplants.
"
23,8,Mrs. Biggle,"No, that's very true, isn't it? We were just thinking that your microbiome is so healthy now , and it would be nice to share a little. 
"
23,8,Sheila,"Yeah.  I mean, i-it's not that I don't want to share everything with my friends, it's just uh, you know, uh, I'm sorry, it's uh, it just doesn't seem right.
"
23,8,Mrs. Biggle,"And that is totally fine.
"
23,8,Laura,"If it doesn't feel right, then it probably isn't right. 
"
23,8,Sheila," Oh, this is Kyle. Sorry, girls, let me take this. 
"
23,8,The other ladies,"Okay.
"
23,8,Mrs. Biggle," That cunt! I told you she'd say no!
"
23,8,Laura,"How much of a bitch can you be? Won't share your feces? Talk about anal-retentive!
"
23,8,Linda S.," Fuck her! Fuck her!
"
23,8,Kyle (voice-over),"Half the cells in my body. Half...  They're inside me right now. Alive.  All over me.  The bookcase.
"
23,8,Kyle," Aaah!
"
23,8,Kyle,"Do you guys have any idea what I'm saying?! Half the cells in our bodies aren't human! Right now there are alive creatures in your eyelashes and in your teeth!
"
23,8,Cartman,"So?
"
23,8,Kyle,"So?! Right now, that straw has a bunch of little bugs and they're going in your mouth and mixing with trillions of other little bugs that are alive inside you! You aren't even totally you!
"
23,8,Stan,"Dude, Kyle, why are you talking about all this?
"
23,8,Kyle,"Okay, guys, listen. My mom had a fecal transplant.
"
23,8,Cartman," Fecal transplant!
"
23,8,Mrs. Biggle,"Hi Kyle. I'm Harriet, Henrietta and Bradley's mommy. I've been looking all over town for you.
"
23,8,Kyle,"Why?
"
23,8,Harriet,"Well, I went to the video game store and I bought this.  Jedi: Fallen Order. It's getting great reviews. Thought you might want it.
"
23,8,Cartman,"Whaaat?
"
23,8,Stan,"Yeah, he wants it.
"
23,8,Harriet,"Great. Could you do just one little thing for me, Kyle?
"
23,8,Kenny,"(Yeah. He'll do anything.) 
"
23,8,Harriet,"When you get back home, could you find a way to get a little of your mom's poop, and put it in this jar? 
"
23,8,Kyle,"What?! Eww! No!
"
23,8,Cartman,"Yes!
"
23,8,Harriet,"I don't need much. I'm sure you can find a way to sneak it from her. You do that and the game is all yours.
"
23,8,Kyle,"That is disgusting. Absolutely not!
"
23,8,Cartman,"Kyle!
"
23,8,Harriet,"Oh well, think about it. The offer stands. I heard you can customize your own lightsaber. 
"
23,8,Cartman,"What is your problem?!
"
23,8,Kyle,"What is MY problem?! I'm not gonna go steal my mom's shit!
"
23,8,Stan,"Dude, you realize we won't get that game 'till Christmas. We could be playing it tomorrow.
"
23,8,Kenny,"(TO-MORROW!)
"
23,8,Kyle,"I said ""no"", and that's final!
"
23,8,Stan,"She's in. Kyle's mom just squatted in the toilet. 
"
23,8,Cartman,"Okay, we've got contact. Are you ready with the bucket, Kenny?
"
23,8,Kenny,"Got it. 
"
23,8,Cartman,"Place it directly under this pipe.  Alright. That should just about do it.  Now we just wait. For the flush.
"
23,8,Kenny," She's not flushing.
"
23,8,Cartman,"That's good she's not flushing yet. That means she's got more serious business, and serious business is just what we're after.
"
23,8,Stan,"You think she'll poop a big enough log? 
"
23,8,Cartman,"You see how fat Kyle's mom is? That bitch must poop at least two-pounders.
"
23,8,Kyle,"The fuck are you doing?! 
"
23,8,Cartman,"Oh, hey Kyle, What's going on?
"
23,8,Kyle,"You are NOT stealing my mom's shit!
"
23,8,Cartman,"Kyle, this is the world we're living in, okay? People are finding new and exciting ways to get healthy, and who are we to stand in their way? 
"
23,8,Kyle,"It just freaks me out, Doc.  We all have these... things... living inside our bodies, and everyone just seems fine with it. It's like, as soon as people learn they have microbiomes, the first thing they want to do is start swapping them.
"
23,8,Dr. Gauche," Well, young man, the truth is we still don't know a lot about the microbiome, but you shouldn't let it ""freak you out.""
"
23,8,Kyle,"But where does it stop?! Then, are people just gonna start wanting skinny people's microbiomes to be skinny? Or an athlete's microbiome to feel athletic and young again?
"
23,8,Dr. Gauche,"Yes, it's possible, but we don't know enough. There is no superfeces which can make you athletic and young. 
"
23,8,Kyle,"Well like, what about Tom Brady's poop?
"
23,8,Dr. Gauche,"
"
23,8,Kyle,"I'm just saying that Tom Brady seems to work really hard on his diet and stuff. His shit must be pretty good.
"
23,8,Dr. Gauche,"
"
23,8,Kyle," What?
"
23,8,Dr. Gauche,"Nothing. 
"
23,8,Announcer,"And now back to ""One For The Ladies.""
"
23,8,Linda S.,"Have you been in that store at all?
"
23,8,Laura,"No. I think it's new, isn't it?
"
23,8,Linda S.,"It used to be that watch store.
"
23,8,Laura,"Oh my God. Harriet?
"
23,8,Harriet," Oh, hi girls. What's new?
"
23,8,Linda S.,"My goodness, look at you!
"
23,8,Laura,"You look great! What happened?
"
23,8,Harriet,"Fecal transplant. It's true what they say: I feel 20 years younger. 
"
23,8,A driver," Looking good, Mrs. B.
"
23,8,Harriet,"Fecal transplant, Damon. Keep your eyes in the road!
"
23,8,Sheila,"Harriet?
"
23,8,Harriet,"Oh. Hey, Sheila. 
"
23,8,Sheila,"You're looking chipper today.
"
23,8,Harriet,"Yeah, I had a little procedure done. Fecal transplant.
"
23,8,Sheila,"I though the doctor wouldn't give you a fecal transplant, Harriet.
"
23,8,Harriet,"No, I... did it myself. With a turkey baster.
"
23,8,Sheila,"Where did you get the feces?
"
23,8,Harriet,"Well, it's really none of your business, Sheila. It's a private matter, a fecal transplant. I'd really rather not talk about it. See you girls! 
"
23,8,The other ladies,"Bye, Harriet! 
"
23,8,Laura,"Two-faced bitch! You know what she said about you at lunch?
"
23,8,Sheila,"What?
"
23,8,Linda S.,"She called you the C-word!
"
23,8,Sheila,"You're joking!
"
23,8,Laura,"Oh no! Clearly she couldn't stand that you were the only one whose shit didn't stink.
"
23,8,Linda S.,"Fuck her! Fuck her!
"
23,8,Mr. Mackey,"Boys, I brought you in here because some rumors are floatin' around the school, m'kay? These rumors are that you three somehow stole feces from Kyle's mom, m'kay, and gave it to Mrs. Biggle in return for ""Jedi: Fallen Order.""
"
23,8,Cartman,"That is 100% untrue.
"
23,8,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, well someone in this school is a little turd burglar, and I want some answers!
"
23,8,Stan,"How can answer that to which we have no knowledge?
"
23,8,Cartman,"Very nice, very nice.
"
23,8,Mr. Mackey,"It must be hard, having to take turns playing ""Jedi: Fallen Order."" It's a single-player game, I believe.
"
23,8,Cartman,"Wouldn't know.
"
23,8,Mr. Mackey,"Oh. Because... I could get you each your own copy. That would be a lot of fun, wouldn't it? You guys stole the poop. Could you do it again?
"
23,8,Stan,"You want us to steal some of Kyle's mom's poop for you?
"
23,8,Mr. Mackey,"Not Kyle's mom's. Someone else's.
"
23,8,Cartman,"Whose?
"
23,8,Mr. Mackey,"
"
23,8,Tom,"Alright. Alright, I'm... proud of our team today. It was uh... You know, I thought our defense did a great job keepin' us in the game, and again, I think the offense has a lot of room for improvement and all that... starts with me. Questions? Yeah.
"
23,8,Reporter 1,"Can we have your poop?
"
23,8,Tom,"No. Guys, I'm not gonna take any requests for my microbiome. I just wanna focus on the team. We're 10-1 now, you know, but, we can't let up. Yeah?
"
23,8,Sportwriter,"Please, can we have your poop?
"
23,8,Tom,"Okay, I'm not, I'm not gonna stay our here, you guys. It's just- Does anyone have a real question?
"
23,8,Reporter 2,"Tom, after you leave here, are you gonna go eat somewhere or go right home and have a-
"
23,8,Tom,"Nono, no. See, I'm not gonna tell you where I'm going, because you're all gonna try and follow me into the bathroom. You're not taking my feces, so unless you have a football question, we're done here.
"
23,8,Reporter 1,"Can we buy your poop?
"
23,8,Publicist,"You have to understand. A lot of people want things from Tom Brady. He has to be a little protective.
"
23,8,Stan,"Yes, we do understand. We just... well, since you're his publicist. we thought that... you could give Mr. Brady our message. 
"
23,8,Cartman," It's all right, Stan. Don't cry. You see, ma'am, our little friend Kenny here is dying, and he's... he's just the biggest Patriots fan.
"
23,8,Publicist,"You know, I can call him, but he's very busy right now with the season.
"
23,8,Stan,"Well if Mr. Brady could just, you know, have Kenny stay over at his house for a night.
"
23,8,Cartman,"Kind of, like a Michael Jackson kind of thing.  Oh gosh, we're losin' him! We need to make this happen quickly, ma'am.
"
23,8,Publicist,"
"
23,8,Cartman,"Uh, ma'am?
"
23,8,Publicist," Let me... see what I can do.
"
23,8,Sheila,"Girls, can I just say... you both look fantastic.
"
23,8,Laura," Oh, thanks, girlfriend. We've been working out and dieting, you know. Not cheating like that bitch Harriet.
"
23,8,Sheila,"Well, it's great you guys are doing it the natural way. amd we don't have to deal with Harriet anymore. 
"
23,8,Harriet,"There you are, you Goddamned bitch! I will take you to court, fat whore!
"
23,8,Sheila,"Harriet, I do not like your tone.
"
23,8,Harriet,"You knew I was gonna steal your poo, and so you tainted it, didn't you?!
"
23,8,Sheila,"What are you talking about?
"
23,8,Harriet,"I have been shitting and throwing up all day! It has to be from your feces!
"
23,8,Sheila,"So you DID take my poo, huh, Harriet?!
"
23,8,Harriet,"That's besides the point now!
"
23,8,Sheila,"Oh, IS it? 'Cause the girls told me you called me the C-word the other day.
"
23,8,Harriet,"Oh, you're all backstabbing bitches now?!
"
23,8,Linda S.,"Fuck you, Harriet!
"
23,8,Male Diner,"Oho. Okay ladies, come on.
"
23,8,Harriet,"Just admit it! I can't stop puking and shitting because of what you did to me!
"
23,8,Laura,"Oh. Gaw! 
"
23,8,Harriet,"What the fuck?!
"
23,8,Linda S.,"You thought you were such hot shit, Harriet! We took the leftover feces from your house and put it up our asses with a turkey baster! Oh! Oh God! 
"
23,8,Announcer,"And now back to ""One For The Ladies.""
"
23,8,Cartman,"Hello, ma'am. We are the darling children whose dying friend is all set to meet Tom Brady.
"
23,8,Mabel," I am Mabel Gonzales, the housekeeper. 
"
23,8,Cartman,"
"
23,8,Stan,"
"
23,8,Kenny,"
"
23,8,Mabel,"Come on in. Mr. Brady is just using the bathroom. 
"
23,8,Dr. Gauche,"We've got more sick incoming! Try and make some more room!  We have a major epidemic here, Detective. C. diff. has spread to half the town. We don't have enough staff or enough to supplies to keep up with it.
"
23,8,Yates,"How does this happen?
"
23,8,Dr. Gauche,"Apparently, the outbreak started at a restaurant when some women got sick on everybody. The women contracted C. diff. by giving themselves DIY fecal transplants.
"
23,8,Yates,"So they got sick from another woman's feces?
"
23,8,Dr. Gauche,"No, they got sick from using this,  A common household turkey baster. It's a thing most people use just once a year, around Thanksgiving. The rest of the year it just sits in a drawer collecting bacteria, and then the ladies went and stuck it up their asses.
"
23,8,Yates,"Oh, those ladies!
"
23,8,Dr. Gauche,"It gets worse. We're completely out of healthy donor feces. Even if we found a donor at this point, it wouldn't be enough to give everyone transplants.
"
23,8,Yates,"So what happens next?
"
23,8,Dr. Gauche,"With how contagious C. diff. is and how deadly, half of South Park is going to die.
"
23,8,Yates," Jesus. What have those rascally ladies done?
"
23,8,Stan,"So, you're all here to meet Tom Brady too?
"
23,8,Sportswriter,"Yeah, I'm a sportswriter, getting a little interview. 
"
23,8,Mom,"Yes, and we're here with our little girl who's dying, just like your friend.
"
23,8,Theresa,"I'm dying, mommy?
"
23,8,Mom,"Shut up, Theresa! 
"
23,8,Mabel,"Everyone, the honorable Thomas Brady.
"
23,8,Tom,"Hey, everybody. 
"
23,8,Sportswriter," The rest of you, stand back! They all deceived you, Mr. Brady! They only want to get the spice mélange.
"
23,8,Tom,"Oh God, not again. Alright, everybody out. Come on, let's go.
"
23,8,Cartman,"Mr. Brady, can we just see your basement really fast?
"
23,8,Tom,"Nope, nope, that's all. If you people want a healthy microbiome, then proper diet and healthy choices, alright? That's it! You are all being ridiculous! 
"
23,8,Stan,"Kyle, dude, what are you doing here? 
"
23,8,Cartman,"You don't get to be part of Turd Burglars now, Kyle! 
"
23,8,Kyle,"The bookcase. 
"
23,8,All,"Whoa!
"
23,8,Tom,"Okay, look. I got sick of people going to my basement and screwing with my plumbing
"
23,8,Sportswriter,"The spice! So much of it!
"
23,8,Mabel,"Enough for everyone! Enough to bring peace to all!
"
23,8,Tom,"I stopped flushing them because people kept breaking my pipes to get them.
"
23,8,Publicist,"Never did I think so much of it could be obtained.
"
23,8,Mom,"This is enough for all the universe!
"
23,8,Tom,"I mean, you'd all do the same thing if people were always trying to steal your shit. 
"
23,8,Dr. Gauche,"That's good. Stay still. Almost there.
"
23,8,Harriet,"Oh, Sheila, I'm so sorry for stealing your feces.
"
23,8,Linda S.,"And we're sorry for stealing it from you, Harriet.
"
23,8,Sheila,"Girls, this was all my fault. I think I got a little carried away bragging about my fecal transplant.
"
23,8,Laura,"I hope we can all be besties again.
"
23,8,Dr. Gauche," You ladies are pretty lucky. If it hadn't been for these little turd burglars here, you'd be dead. And also responsible for the deaths of countless others.
"
23,8,Sheila,"Kyle, how did you do it? I mean, how did you even know what was going on?
"
23,8,Kyle,"I didn't know. My microbiome did. All along they were trying to tell me something. I really learned that I'm not just me. I'm also all the creatures inside of me. From now on, I'm gonna trust my gut a little more. 
"
23,8,Dr. Gauche,"Well, I think we've all learned something. One for the ladies is one too many for the ladies. 
"
23,9,Scott," Dad? Dad, I love you. I love you so much, Dad. 
"
23,9,Scott's Mom,"What is it, Scott?
"
23,9,Scott,"Ninety, Mom.
"
23,9,Scott's Mom,"Okay, great. 
"
23,9,Scott," Dad, I love you.
"
23,9,Scott's Dad,"What?
"
23,9,Scott,"I love you so much, Dad. Please, can we get Disney+?
"
23,9,Scott's Dad,"Goddamnit, not this shit again! No!  We don't need Disney Fucking Plus, Scott! We got cable, and that's enough!  All this talk about Disney+ and CBS Max and shit on a fucking extreme prime! Where's it gonna end?! Straight to fucking hell, that's where! I'm going to work! 
"
23,9,Scott," Shit!  Asshole!
"
23,9,Mr. Mackey,"Okay, kids, if we can all be quiet, please? Today is a very special day, because we have a new student who just moved to town and will be starting her schoolastic adventures here in South Park. I know you're gonna be very kind, and make her feel at home.
"
23,9,Cartman," Hehyeah.
"
23,9,Mr. Mackey,"Please say hi to Sophie Gray.
"
23,9,Sophie Gray," Hey, guys. Um, well, I moved here from Arizona, I really like soccer, and I love The Mandalorian, and, um, I guess one thing about me that might be kind of different is that I have diabetes.
"
23,9,Scott,"Say what??
"
23,9,Sophie,"I have a thing called diabetes. It's a condition that affects the way my body processes sugar. It just means that I have to check my blood sugar once in a while, and sometimes I have to...  ...part of who I am. Oh, and I also have a pony.
"
23,9,Scott,"Holy shit, guys! What am I gonna do?!
"
23,9,Stan,"About what?
"
23,9,Scott,"About Sophie Gray! She's my boo! I love her! What am I supposed to say to her.
"
23,9,Cartman,"Scott, you can't be with Sophie Gray. She has diabetes.
"
23,9,Scott,"I know! That's why she's perfect!
"
23,9,Cartman,"No, Scott, if you and Sophie have a baby, it'll have super diabetes. I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure that causes a crater on the Earth.
"
23,9,Jimmy,"That girl is pretty fly. As soon as she said she watches Mandalorian, it gave me a little boner. If you wanna be with a new girl, you're gonna have some stiff competition. Get it? Stiff? C-, c-, c-, c-, competition.
"
23,9,Scott,"But she has diabetes. You guys always rip on me for having diabetes.
"
23,9,Cartman," You guys always rip on me for havin' diabetes. I'm Scott Malkinson. 
"
23,9,Scott,"No! Not this time! You guys aren't ruining Scott Malkinson's life again! I'm taking control! Do you understand?! 
"
23,9,Cartman," I'm taking control do you understand I'm Scott Malkinson I have diabetes. 
"
23,9,Dispatcher,"Hey Clark. Clark, are you there?
"
23,9,Scott's Dad," This is Clark. Go ahead.
"
23,9,Dispatcher,"Yeah hey, I think we actually have a job. The Stotches need their cable box looked at.
"
23,9,Clark,"Alright, I'm on it!
"
23,9,Dispatcher,"Uh, listen, Clark, part of why we're losing customers is 'cause people say our service is slow.
"
23,9,Clark,"Don't worry, I'll be there as fast as I can!
"
23,9,Cashier,"Welcome to McDonald's. Can I take your order?
"
23,9,Clark,"Number 3 value meal, no pickle.
"
23,9,Stephen,"Oh. Well, finally! The cable company gave us a window from noon to 5 for you to show up, It's 5:15.
"
23,9,Clark," Well I'm only 15 minutes late.
"
23,9,Stephen,"This is why we should quit cable and just go to streaming services.
"
23,9,Clark,"Oh, you want quantity over quality?! Streaming services are destroying our town! People don't watch and bond over the same shows anymore! Everyone watches somethin' different! 'Cause you got assholes in Hollywood making little niche programs for everybody! That's what you want?!
"
23,9,Stephen," Yeah, I think I do.
"
23,9,A Boy,"Uhh, hi.  You're the new girl, right? i> Just wanted to say, you know, welcome to the school. 
"
23,9,Sophie,"Oh thanks. That's really nice of you.
"
23,9,Pete,"I was wondering if maybe sometime, well I could show around if you need it.
"
23,9,Sophie,"Wow, that'd be great. A couple of the other guys offered too.
"
23,9,Pete," Yeah, a lot of the guys here are posers though. You gotta be careful.
"
23,9,Sophie,"That's funny. Another one of the guys said that. He was the tall kid that kinda dresses like you. 
"
23,9,Pete,"Oh yeah, he's a total poser. 
"
23,9,Scott," God damnit! Fucking asshole. 
"
23,9,Sophie,"...yeah, and so my dad actually still lives in Scottsdale.
"
23,9,Pete,"Scottsdale. Love it there.
"
23,9,Scott," Hi Sophie. Hoe's it going?
"
23,9,Pete,"Ow! Watch it, dork!
"
23,9,Scott,"I have something really important to tell you, Sophie. It can't wait.
"
23,9,Sophie,"Oh, okay.  I'll see you around, huh?
"
23,9,Pete,"Yeah, sure thing. 
"
23,9,Scott,"So, uh, you have diabetes, right?
"
23,9,Sophie,"Yeah.
"
23,9,Scott," I... have diabetes. 
"
23,9,Sophie,"Oh. 
"
23,9,Scott,"So... what do you wanna do now? 
"
23,9,Scott,"So... what's your favorite food... that you can't eat? Mine's waffles.
"
23,9,Sophie,"Um, I haven't really thought about it.
"
23,9,Scott,"Oh...
"
23,9,Sophie,"Do you watch The Mandalorian on Disney+?
"
23,9,Scott,"Oh... Ughuh, yeah, of course. I love The Mandalorian.
"
23,9,Sophie,"Right? It's the best Star Wars thing since Empire. Makes all the new movies look like dog shit.
"
23,9,Scott,"Yeah, like, super dog shit.
"
23,9,Clyde," Hey, you're the new girl, right?
"
23,9,Scott,"She's busy! 
"
23,9,Sophie,"Hey, are you gonna watch the new episode on Friday? We could watch it together if you want.
"
23,9,Scott,"Oh my God. I would love that.
"
23,9,Sophie,"Okay. I'll be over right when it starts streaming.
"
23,9,Scott,"Oh. Well, uh, the thing is, I, I mean uh...
"
23,9,Timmy," Timmih!
"
23,9,Scott," She's busy, and she's watching Mandalorian at my house!
"
23,9,Timmy,"Timmih... 
"
23,9,Clark,"Look at that. Look. Two hundred and forty channels of anything we wanna watch. No accounts! No fucking passwords! Just pure, simple, basic cable.
"
23,9,Scott," Mom! Dad! Guess what?! 
"
23,9,Clark,"Not now, Scott. Your mom and I are enjoying watching whatever we want  and not signing up for anything.
"
23,9,Scott,"But Dad, there's this new girl in school, and she has... diabetes!
"
23,9,Mrs. Malkinson,"Oh, that's wonderful, Scott.
"
23,9,Scott,"Yeah. And guess what? She wants to come over to our house! So we HAVE to get Disney+!
"
23,9,Clark,"Oh, not this shit again! The answer is no! 
"
23,9,Scott,"Dad, please! This is my life!
"
23,9,Clark,"Streaming services are destroying our culture, Scott! People got a thousand shows at their fingertips 24/7, so Hollywood has to make shows within their shows to make more shows!
"
23,9,Scott,"But Dad, what's wrong with people watching what they wanna watch when they wanna watch it?
"
23,9,Clark," ""What's wrong with people watching what they wanna watch when they wanna watch it? I'm Scott Malkinson. I have diabetes."" 
"
23,9,Scott,"Unbelievable!! 
"
23,9,Clark," Yeah, it's me. It's time we took down all these streaming services down. Tell all the guys we're meeting ASAP, in a window between 10 am and 2 pm Thursday.
"
23,9,Clark,"Goddamnit, where are they?! We're gonna run out of time!  Where the hell have you guys been?!
"
23,9,Repairman 1 (Bill),"You gave us a window of 10 am to 2 pm. It's 1:50.
"
23,9,Clark,"""Between 10 and 2 doesn't mean you wait until 1-fucking-50!""
"
23,9,Repairman 2 (Kurt),"Wow. What's wrong with you??
"
23,9,Clark,"What's wrong is that we;'re losin' our asses to these sons of bitches! I don't know about you buys, but I haven't worked a full day in weeks! 
"
23,9,Repairman 2,"Hey, that's right.
"
23,9,Clark,"These streaming services all still need the Internet to stream, right? And who laid all that cable those companies are streamin' on?!
"
23,9,The other workers,"We did.
"
23,9,Clark,"That's right. We fucking did. We're cable repairmen! We control what goes into people's houses! Us! It's time that we work together and show people how much they still need us!
"
23,9,Repairman 3 (Michael),"Yeah! Let's uncouple the stranded conductor!
"
23,9,Repairman 2,"Let's tear the insulation off the retractile cables.
"
23,9,Clark,"Bill and Dave, you get supplies from the electronics store! Kurt, you help Michael with the hardware we're gonna need! Let's meet at the breaker between 4 and 7 pm!
"
23,9,The other workers,"Yeah! 
"
23,9,Announcer,"You're watching Canada Ploos. Your source for all Canadian entertainment.
"
23,9,Cartman," Oh, that's pretty cool.
"
23,9,Announcer,"Which Canadian program would you like to watch?  Terrance & Philip. The Queef Sisters. Terrance & Philip. The Queef Sisters. Terrance &-. The Queef Sis-. 
"
23,9,Katie,"Katherine, I have some bad news.
"
23,9,Katherine,"What is it, Katie? 
"
23,9,Cartman,"Agh, goddamnit. 
"
23,9,Scott,"You gotta help me!
"
23,9,Cartman,"With what?
"
23,9,Scott,"With my baby girl!  She's everything to me, bro, but to impress her, I have to get Disney+. How can I get it without my parents' credit card?
"
23,9,Cartman,"You don't wanna go around messin' with that.
"
23,9,Scott," You once had a girlfriend, Eric. You and Heidi were together a long time. You know how important this is.
"
23,9,Cartman," You want my advice? You're better off, Scott. Let some other fool have his life ruined.
"
23,9,Scott,"What are you talking about, Eric? It-
"
23,9,Cartman," Do you know what love is, Scott? I'll tell you one thing: it's not the happy ending that Disney movies promised us. There's just frustration, and anger, and pain. Relationships is diabetes times ten.
"
23,9,Scott,"I can handle diabetes. I can handle a relationship.
"
23,9,Cartman,"Fine. I'll tell you how to get Disney+. But when you feel like killing yourself in two years, don't do it in front of me.
"
23,9,Clark,"Alright, let's do this!  Dave? Dave, you got everything from the electronics store?
"
23,9,Dave,"Not yet. Still workin' on it.
"
23,9,Clark,"Well what the fuck are you doing?!
"
23,9,Dave,"You gave me a window from noon to 3 to get it all; it's only 2:45.
"
23,9,Clark,"God-fucking-damnit, can we get the show on the road here, guys?! Kurt, you got the cable splitters?
"
23,9,Kurt," ...Huh?
"
23,9,Clark,"Goddamnit, get the cable splitters!
"
23,9,Nathan,"Steaming accounts and passwords! Steaming accounts! Passwords!
"
23,9,Scott,"Ah, hey.
"
23,9,Nathan,"Hey. What's going on?
"
23,9,Scott,"Uuhh, Eric Cartman told me you have access to streaming accounts.
"
23,9,Nathan,"Maybe I do, and maybe I don't. Are you a cop?
"
23,9,Scott,"No, I'm Scott Malkinson. I go to your school.
"
23,9,Nathan,"Never heard of you.
"
23,9,Scott,"Haven't you ever heard the other kids say, ""I'm Scott Malkinson. I have diabetes""? Uh I'm Scott Malkinson.
"
23,9,Nathan,"Oh, yeah. Well, in that case,  Hulu? Netflix? HBO Max? I got all the accounts and passwords you need.
"
23,9,Scott,"No, I need a Disney+ account.
"
23,9,Nathan,"Oh, you want the good stuff. That's pricey. Hard to find. What uh-are you lookin' to trade?
"
23,9,Scott,"I have two 16-needle boxes of insulin. 
"
23,9,Nathan,"Oh. Oh God. Oh! Ohhhhhhh!  Yeah, that's pretty good shit.  Alright, here you go.  Disney+ account and password.
"
23,9,Clark,"Alright, I got the static coupler conected to the RF switch. You got the BT router undone, dave?
"
23,9,Dave,"Yeah. Yeah, I think that's got it.
"
23,9,Clark,"Okay. Let's throw the pulse cable!  Yeah, I think that's good.
"
23,9,Scott,"Oh God. 
"
23,9,Sophie,"Hey!
"
23,9,Scott,"Hi, Sophie.
"
23,9,Sophie," The show starts streaming in two minutes!  I have to watch right when it starts streaming. I hate spoilers.
"
23,9,Scott,"Me too!
"
23,9,Sophie,"This'll be a great place to watch it.  Uh oh. Hey, do you have some juice or something? My blood sugar is a little low.
"
23,9,Scott,"Oh my God, I love you so much.
"
23,9,Sophie,"Huh?
"
23,9,Scott," Uh, uhhh, here you go. I have lots of juices standing by.
"
23,9,Sophie,"Great!  Mm, okay, it's time. Put it on.
"
23,9,Scott,"O-kay!  and clicks on it.
"
23,9,Sophie,"Ohmygod ohmygod ohmygod ohmygod! Yesyesyesyes!  Hey, uh, what's going on?
"
23,9,Scott,"I, uh I don't know. 
"
23,9,Dean,"This is item number 45-78111.
"
23,9,Sophie,"Can you change it back?
"
23,9,Scott,"It, ih-it's not... working.
"
23,9,Dean,"Look at these stunning ear-  I don't know what's going on!
"
23,9,Sophie,"It's gonna be okay. That Jimmy kid invited me to watch at his house. Come on! 
"
23,9,Scott," Oh no, not Jimmy! Bae? Bae, come back!
"
23,9,Emory,"Now back to PC Babies.
"
23,9,Stan,"PC Babies? What the hell is this?  
"
23,9,Kyle,"Put it back to Mandalorian, Jimmy! Nobody likes PC Babies. 
"
23,9,Jimmy," I'm trying, but... something's wrong with the TV.
"
23,9,Dean,"-teen karat gold-
"
23,9,Cartman,"This is bullcrap! Give me that thing!
"
23,9,Announcer,"You're watching Canada Ploos. 
"
23,9,Cartman,"Goddamnit! 
"
23,9,Jimmy,"Oh. Hey, Sophie.
"
23,9,Scott," And Scott.
"
23,9,Sophie,"Hay! Hope it's still okay to come over?
"
23,9,Jimmy,"Sure. Come on in.  Hey, look who's here, fellas. It's Sophie.
"
23,9,Scott,"And Scott!
"
23,9,The Boys,"Hey, Sophie.
"
23,9,Sophie,"Oh no, your streaming services are messing up too?
"
23,9,Stan,"What do you mean? This isn't just happening here?
"
23,9,Sophie,"No. We were just at Scott's house and it was the same thing. This is terrible!
"
23,9,Cartman," Hey, don't worry, Sophie. We can go watch it together at Tolkien's house. His family has the best AV equipment.
"
23,9,Scott,"Oh, what happened to ""girls are just like diabetes""?!
"
23,9,Stan,"Let's just hurry and get to Tolkien's house!
"
23,9,Kyle,"Yeah! Come on, Sophie!
"
23,9,Scott,"And Scott!
"
23,9,Steve Black," We're the Blacks, a hip family just trying to get by. The problem is, our neighbors.
"
23,9,Bob White,"We're the Whites. Nobody cares if bad things ever happen to us anymore. And things are getting worse. 
"
23,9,Both men,"Because in this town, it's The Whites And The Blacks, on Amazon Prime.
"
23,9,Linda S.," What the? What is wrong with this stupid thing?!
"
23,9,Stephen,"Aha, I don't even know who to call, uh. Here, let me try something. 
"
23,9,Clark," Here it comes. Here it comes.  Park County Cable. Oh, your streaming isn't working. Huh. Gee, I'm sorry, that's really not our problem.  Uh, ohuh sir, can you hang on? I got another call.  Clark County Cable. None of your streaming services are working either? Don't worry. You and everyone else in this town can count on your local cable company. We'll come fix the problem.  Alright guys, let's be the heroes this town needs!
"
23,9,The repairmen,"Yeah!!
"
23,9,Announcer,"You're watching Crab People on HBO Max.
"
23,9,Sheriff," So you say that these mutant crab people came up from under the ground and started eating children?
"
23,9,Woman,"Nonono, Crab People was the show that came on TV when I was trying to watch Stranger Things on Netflix.
"
23,9,Sheriff,"Oh. 
"
23,9,Sophie,"Mom, I can't watch Mandalorian anywhere.  oh no, it's happening here too?
"
23,9,Sophie's Mom,"Who are all these boys, Sophie?
"
23,9,Cartman,"Hello ma'am. I'm Eric Cartman. How are you?
"
23,9,Jimmy,"Uh hi, Muh my name is Jimmy.
"
23,9,Stan,"Uh, my name's Stan Marsh. 
"
23,9,Clyde,"...Clyde Donovan.
"
23,9,Cartman,"Yeah yeah, nobody cares, Clyde. 
"
23,9,Stan,"Well, it looks like nobody's streaming shows tonight. Sorry, Sophie.
"
23,9,Cartman,"Not as sorry as I am, Sophie.
"
23,9,Jimmy,"I-I'm the most sorriest, So-Sophie.
"
23,9,Scott," Yyeeaahh!  You assholes, stop talking to her!
"
23,9,Stan,"Scott?
"
23,9,Scott,"I am done having you all ruin my life! You hear me?! Done! You've taken my dignity for all these years, but you are not taking my girlfriend!
"
23,9,Sophie,"What are you talking about, Scott? I'm not your girlfriend.
"
23,9,Scott," Eh. You're not?
"
23,9,Cartman,"Uh oh, looks like you got some pie on your face, Scott.
"
23,9,Sophie,"I'm not anyone's girlfriend! I just fucking moved here, you guys. Can I have some time to unpack the shit in my room?
"
23,9,Scott,"But Sophie, you're totally my type! Type I diabetes!
"
23,9,Sophie,"Scott, I'm more than just my diabetes.
"
23,9,Scott," ...Well I'm not. I'm Scott Malkinson. 
"
23,9,Sophie,"Need a candy bar?  You're low, right?  Here.  It stinks having diabetes sometimes, huh?
"
23,9,Scott,"You seem to do alright.
"
23,9,Sophie,"Still sucks. Kids don't know how much extra you have to do every day just to be okay.
"
23,9,Scott,"Yeah.
"
23,9,Sophie,"I'm glad there's a kid at my new school who I can talk about diabetes with.
"
23,9,Scott,"You don't think I'm weird and gross?
"
23,9,Sophie,"You know what? I don't think you're any weirder and grosser than any of the other boys in this town.
"
23,9,Scott,"Wow. That's the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me. I'm sorry you missed your show, Sophie. I don't know what happened, but somehow I feel like it's my fault.
"
23,9,Sophie,"That's okay. I had an interesting night. I think I kind of like the Scott Malkinson Show.
"
23,9,Clark,"Okay, we're here! Let's geh-aaah, shit! 
"
23,10,Mayor McDaniels,"Alright, everyone! Are we enjoying the festivities?!  Well, it's time for a very special guest now. Here he is, SANTA! 
"
23,10,The boys,"Santa!
"
23,10,Santa," Merry Christmas, everyone! This is the season for joy and giving. But let's also not forget that unfortunately, it's the season for accidents caused by drunk driving.  Did you know that the holidays are when the most DUIs and drinking-related accidents occur?
"
23,10,Townsman 1,"This is like that little Greta girl with the global warming.  BUZZ KILL! 
"
23,10,Santa,"Please, be sure to celebrate the holiday season responsibly, because last holiday season  The-, the most drunk-driving accidents than ever bef-
"
23,10,Townsman 2,"We're trying to have fun here, Santa!
"
23,10,Santa,"Okay, okay, Come on. All Santa is saying is that drinking and driving during the holidays-
"
23,10,Mayor," Okay, thank you, Santa! That was wonderful and informative. Thank you for coming , everyone. We hope your and your loved ones enjoy all your favorite holiday traditions. 
"
23,10,Stephen,"Yeah! Let's drive! 
"
23,10,Stephen," Mornin', Jim. Mornin', Kate.
"
23,10,Jim,"Mornin', Stotch.
"
23,10,Stephen,"You really tied one one last night, huh? Happy holidays.
"
23,10,Jimbo,"What the hell's goin' on?
"
23,10,Bob,"Uh we c-, we don't know.
"
23,10,Stephen," Hey guys.  The fuck is this?
"
23,10,Jimbo,"There's like a... chain blocking the liquor aisle.
"
23,10,Bob,"Maybe we can just go around to the other side. Come on! 
"
23,10,Jimbo,"What the hell?
"
23,10,Mr. Mackey,"I don't know. There's some sort of blockage in front of the booth section.
"
23,10,Stephen,"But this is ridiculous.  Manager? Manager!
"
23,10,"Jason, the Manager"," Can I help you?
"
23,10,Stephen,"Manager, there's a chain and sign blocking our way into the liquor aisle.
"
23,10,Jason,"Yes. We can't sell liquor during the holidays. Somebody got a new county ordinance passed.
"
23,10,Stephen,"What? Who has that kind of power?
"
23,10,Jimbo,"It's Christmas, damnit! What are we supposed to drink?
"
23,10,Jason,"You gotta just drink what ya have at your house.
"
23,10,Stephen,"We drank it all before driving to the tree-lighting ceremony!
"
23,10,All,"Yeah!
"
23,10,Stephen,"Hey, woah woah woah, wait! Hold on!
"
23,10,Proprietor,"Sorry, everyone. I've been shut down until the New Year.
"
23,10,Jimbo,"No! Not you too??
"
23,10,Liane,"You must have something you can give us.
"
23,10,Proprietor,"All I've got is this little bottle of peppermint schnapps, but it's barely enough form my drive home.
"
23,10,Stephen," I've got family coming over, from out of town! You can't expect me to be sober! 
"
23,10,Stephen,"Skeeter! Thank God you're still open. I've me a Cabernet, huh? And a couple of bottles to take home.
"
23,10,Skeeter,"I've got lemonade, soft drinks, and tea. That's all I can sell until January 2nd.
"
23,10,Richard,"Son of a bitch!
"
23,10,Liane,"This can't be happening.
"
23,10,Jimbo,"Hey, come on, guys. It's still Christmas, and we have to make the best of it. How about we all drive around a little?
"
23,10,Stephen,"Oh what's the point, Jimbo? What's the point in driving now?
"
23,10,Mayor,"Nobody's out shopping. The town is dead. Our economy depends on the holidays.
"
23,10,Janson,"We don't know who passed the ordinance, Mayor, but... well, the people feel left out.
"
23,10,Mayor,"There's only one thing we can do. We're going to have to ask an old friend for help... and hope that he somehow forgives us.
"
23,10,Randy,"Hello, Mayor,... everybody. What are you doing here?
"
23,10,Mayor,"Mr. Marsh, South Park needs you.
"
23,10,Randy,"For what?
"
23,10,Mayor,"Everyone's down in the dumps. Nobody's buying presents or going to holiday events.
"
23,10,Richard,"People... they need some holiday spirit.
"
23,10,Mayor,"We think that... a little weed might put everyone in a better mood.
"
23,10,Randy,"Guys, my season is over. Tegridy Farms' season ended weeks ago.
"
23,10,Mayor,"We understand, but couldn't you do like a limited-edition run just to get people through the holidays?
"
23,10,Randy,"...You want me to do a... Christmas special?
"
23,10,Mayor,"Yes. South Park needs Tegridy Farms.
"
23,10,Stephen,"We all do, Randy.
"
23,10,Randy,"But guys, look behind you.  The crops are dead. How am I supposed to sell weed to people now?
"
23,10,Mayor,"I'll tell you how.  Because you're Randy Marsh, and there's one thing you have that nobody else does. Tegridy.
"
23,10,Randy,"Tegridy.
"
23,10,Stephen,"You a-you're not gonna let a little cold weather stand in your way. Tegridy Farms is about community.
"
23,10,Mrs. Tweek,"And community is what matters. That's Tegridy. That's Tegridy Weed.
"
23,10,Randy,"Well, you're right about that. Let me call my marijuana science specialist and.... I'll see what I can do.
"
23,10,Mayor,"Thank you, Marsh. May God bless Tegridy Farms.
"
23,10,Towelie,"Look, I'm sorry, Randy, but marijuana just doesn't grow in the cold.
"
23,10,Randy,"So we use the greenhouse. There's gotta be a way to make a Christmas special. It's what everyone wants.
"
23,10,Towelie," Wwwait a minute.  How about we repackage some of the surplus?  I have lots of left-over Mexican Joker.
"
23,10,Randy,"That's 'cause people really didn't like Mexican Joker. I'm not gonna just repackage it. That's not special.
"
23,10,Towelie,"Okay, so how about we combine- what's left of the Mexican Joker with some of the Season Finale?
"
23,10,Randy,"Nagh.
"
23,10,Towelie,"What's wrong?
"
23,10,Randy," It's just... it needs  something else. Just mixing old product together and naming it something new? That's not special.  And it's not Tegridy!  It's just not Tegridy.  It's gonna be your birthday soon, Jesus. I wanna make something as special as you are.  I just need the right idea. 
"
23,10,Stephen,"I hate the holidays.
"
23,10,Linda B.,"Come on, Tolkien! Let!s wrap it up and get out of here! 
"
23,10,Craig,"Dude, our parents seem really bummed out.
"
23,10,Jimmy,"Yeah. It's like someone came and took all their Christmas ssssspirit.
"
23,10,Cartman," This isn't good, you guys. You know what it means when our parents have no Christmas spirit? Shitty presents. We're screwed, you guys.
"
23,10,Butters,"Well they just gotta get their Christmas spirits back. They just gotta.
"
23,10,Kenny," (What's that?!) 
"
23,10,Liane," Look. 
"
23,10,Randy,"Well howdy there, folks.
"
23,10,Gerald,"Randy?
"
23,10,Randy,"Heard you were all a little down and might need a boost. , so I thought I'd bring you some  Christmas Snow.  Whoa whoa, there's enough for everybody. 
"
23,10,Stephen," Oh wow, this smells great!
"
23,10,Thomas,"Hey, what's this white stuff on the top?
"
23,10,Randy,"Just a little somethin' extra for a special kick.
"
23,10,Stephen,"Well, what are we waiting for, everyone? Let's do some driving! 
"
23,10,Announcer,"Now, back to the Tegridy Farms Christmas Special.
"
23,10,Randy,"Oh, hi Mayor.
"
23,10,Mayor,"We need to talk, Marsh! 
"
23,10,Randy,"What's going on? Are people not liking the Christmas special so far?
"
23,10,Mayor," Oh, people loooove the Christmas special.  So, Marsh , what exactly is in this Christmas snow?
"
23,10,Randy,"Okay, okay, look, you busted us. It's a mix of different strains of marijuana we had left over from last season. I know, it's wrong...
"
23,10,Mayor,"Nonono, what is the white stuff on the marijuana?
"
23,10,Randy,"Oh that? That's cocaine.
"
23,10,Mayor,"WHAT???
"
23,10,Randy,"Yeah, I got the idea praying to Christ. You know, powder, snow, it's what gives Christmas Snow its kick.  Getting enough cocaine was the tricky part, so we started growing our own. Turns out the coca plant is even hardier than the marijuana plant. It can grow even when we're out of season.
"
23,10,Mayor,"What is wrong with you?!  We can't have you selling this stuff in town! COCAINE IS ILLEGAL!
"
23,10,Randy,"It is?? 
"
23,10,Mayor,"Jesus Christ, you can't just give people coke without them knowing! We could all go to prison!
"
23,10,Randy,"Hey hey, it's not a big deal. I've been through this before.  Hang on, I'll handle it. Don't go anywhere.
"
23,10,Randy,"Legalize it! Legalize it!
"
23,10,Randy,"Okay, cocaine's totally legal now.
"
23,10,Mayor,"It- it is? 
"
23,10,Randy,"Yeah, legal in seven states including this one, and other states are soon to follow. I told you. It's 2019, dawg.
"
23,10,Butters,"I'm sorry, Santa, I just can't think of anything I want this year. Well I guess maybe now I'm losing my Christmas Spirit.
"
23,10,Santa,"Well, how about a little baby Yoda doll?
"
23,10,Butters,"Neah. Mandalorian was great the first few episodes, but it's really fallin' apart lately. 
"
23,10,Santa,"What on earth?? 
"
23,10,driver," Me-herry Christmas.
"
23,10,Santa,"What the-? How are people still drinking and driving??
"
23,10,Woman," Oh, they aren't drunk, Santa. Everyone's just enjoying this.  Tegridy Farms Christmas Snow. It's organic, locally grown, and available now. 
"
23,10,Townsman (voice),"It's great, Santa.
"
23,10,Mr. Testaburger,"Oh, you gotta try it, Santa. It's really good.
"
23,10,Townsman 3,"Yeah, try it. You gotta try it. It's amazing, Santa.
"
23,10,Santa,"Marijuana? This isn't what Santa meant! I got rid of liquor and now you assholes are all just getting high?! God-fucking-damnit!  Santa will just see about this! 
"
23,10,Randy,"Our Christmas special is so amazing, I don't know how we're gonna keep up with all the demand.
"
23,10,Towelie,"I know. I know. I can't print labels fast enough.
"
23,10,Randy,"We need more help. We're never gonna get enough done in time. Hey Shelley! Hey Shelley! Hey Shelley!
"
23,10,Shelley," What?!
"
23,10,Randy,"Hey Shelley, can you help us make more labels for our Christmas special?
"
23,10,Shelley,"No! I'm not helping you with your stupid blow. 
"
23,10,Randy,"Oh great. My daughter had a marijuana problem and now she has a problem with cocaine.  Ah. Must be more customers.  What the hell is this?
"
23,10,Worker,"New ordinance's been passed by the county. No marijuana sales till after the holidays.
"
23,10,Randy,"Heheey, fuck you. Who has that kind of power?
"
23,10,Worker,"Look, I just do what I'm told, man. Happy holidays.  Hey, but eh, you can't do this.  They just dshut down our business.
"
23,10,Towelie,"What are you talking about?
"
23,10,Randy,"We can't sell marijuana during the holidays.
"
23,10,Towelie,"What are we gonna do?
"
23,10,Randy," We can't give up on the Christmas special. People need it. I think I know a way around this.
"
23,10,Announcer 2," There's somethin' 'bout the holiday season.  Folks seem a little nicer. The days, a little more special.  And sometimes we all need a little pick-me-up without any added ingredients.  Introducing marijuana-free Christmas Snow from Tegridy Farms.  All the festive snow you love, without that pesky marijuana.  Because there's nothin' like a warm fire, holiday presents,  and a little Rocky Mountain cocaine.  During Christmas, don't you want your cocaine to be organic, pure, and locally-grown?  Cocaine that's grown locally has never been smuggled, so the only ass it's gonna be up is yours.  Marijuana-free Christmas Snow, now available from Tegridy Farms. It's cocaine that's farm to nostril.
"
23,10,Cartman,"Boy, people sure have the holiday spirit now.
"
23,10,Kyle,"Yeah, what the hell happened?
"
23,10,Jimmy,"It's weird, though. My parents have a lot of holiday spirit, but they sleep until three in the afternoon every day.
"
23,10,Craig,"Yeah. Last night, my mom had a ton of holiday spirit and then passed out. She hasn't gone to buy me any presents.
"
23,10,Cartman,"Butters, your mom has so much holiday spirit that she's riding an ATV with her tits out. 
"
23,10,Linda Stotch,"Christmas. Woo-oo-ooo.
"
23,10,Butters,"Yeah, that's a little too much holiday spirit, if you ask me.
"
23,10,Randy,"There you are, ma'am. There you are, sir. This is amazing, Towelie. Tegridy Farms is finally gonna make all the money I ever dreamed of.
"
23,10,Santa," What the Sam Hell is going on here?!  Marijuana-free Christmas Snow? Do you realize that tomorrow is Christmas Eve?!
"
23,10,Stephen,"And it's gonna be the best Christmas ever! 
"
23,10,Female driver,"Happy holidays! Woo!
"
23,10,Santa,"Santa to base, come in.
"
23,10,Elf,"This is base. Go ahead, Santa.
"
23,10,Santa,"Sleigh is too loaded down to fly. Gonna have to take the roads until I can find a place to dump all this blow. 
"
23,10,Randy," Hold on tight, Towelie! We have to save Christmas! 
"
23,10,Santa,"Oh shit!  Ho ho ho!
"
23,10,Randy,"O-ho!  Ohhhhh!
"
23,10,Stephen,"The hell is...? Did you do all my marijuana-free Christmas snow?
"
23,10,Linda," I was just gonna ask you the same thing.
"
23,10,Stephen,"What are you talking about?
"
23,10,Linda,"Mine's all gone. You had another bander last night, didn't you?
"
23,10,Stephen,"No!  Clearly you did!
"
23,10,Stephen,"Thomas, we were just wondering if we could borrow a little Christmas Snow.
"
23,10,Thomas,"You can't find yours either?? My wife's been searching all morning. 
"
23,10,Laura,"The trash. We must have thrown it in the trash. It has to be here somewhere.
"
23,10,Bob,"Alright listen. Somebody obviously took everyone else's snow and it's not cool! Come on. it's Christmas!
"
23,10,Steve,"Somebody has to have a little. I feel like total shit.
"
23,10,Mr. Mackey,"It's gone, okay?! Just face it, it's all gone!
"
23,10,Santa," This is Santa. The sleigh still isn't functional. Got some of it repaired, but I don't think I'm gonna make it back in time for Christmas. 
"
23,10,Randy,"Hey Santa. We need to talk.
"
23,10,Santa,"Stay back, mutherfucker!
"
23,10,Randy,"Santa, you don't understand.
"
23,10,Santa,"Oh, Santa understands plenty! You assholes drink and drive and you think marijuana is somehow different, go driving around on that, and then you go and make this shit!
"
23,10,Randy,"Santa, that's not just cocaine. It's Tegridy cocaine.
"
23,10,Santa,"Oh, don't give Santa that! Coke is coke! 
"
23,10,Randy,"That's not true! This cocaine is grown locally. By local people. Please, just try it!
"
23,10,Santa,"Santa's done coke before. Santa knows what-
"
23,10,Randy,"Please! 
"
23,10,Santa,"It's, it's cocaine. Just like every other cocaine Santa's ever tried. You people really think that the holidays are- Okay, yeah, that's pretty good. But it doesn't matter! Because Christmas is a- Wow, that is really clean.
"
23,10,Randy,"Right?
"
23,10,Santa,"It's like not speedy at all. It's really mellow.  Honestly, I didn't think cocaine could be this pure, wow.
"
23,10,Randy," Because it's grown here. On a farm. It's not cut with any nasty chemicals or harmful impurities. 
"
23,10,Santa,"No, you can tell. It's really clean. Santa likey.  Maybe I have been a little too old-fashioned in my thinking.
"
23,10,Jesus,"I can't believe what I'm hearing! 
"
23,10,Santa,"Oh Jesus.
"
23,10,Jesus,"I have heard your prayers, Marsh! And I've been watching. You want people to think that home-grown cocaine is the same as legalizing marijuana?
"
23,10,Santa,"Jesus, you really gotta try it.
"
23,10,Jesus,"No!
"
23,10,Santa,"You cut out the middle man, nobody dies in South America, nobody dies from impurities .
"
23,10,Randy,"Please, Jesus.
"
23,10,Jesus," Okay, I get it. It's really clean. It's... yeah. It's a good high.
"
23,10,Santa,"It's fucking pure.
"
23,10,Randy,"It's Tegridy.
"
23,10,Jesus,"Well, maybe we all do need a little Tegridy at Christmas time. 
"
23,10,Santa,"What are you doing, Jesus?
"
23,10,Jesus,"I think it's time for a little Christmas miracle. 
"
23,10,Townsman 4," Hey. Hey. Hey, everybody!
"
23,10,Mr. Mackey," Try to catch some on your tongue. It's fun.
"
23,10,Cartman,"Does this mean you all have the Christmas spirit again?
"
23,10,Stephen,"You're darn tootin' we do!
"
23,10,Randy,"Hey guys, I'm so happy my Christmas Special turned out okay.
"
23,10,Santa,"It's more than okay. Tegridy cocaine is smooth and has a great finish.
"
23,10,Jesus,"I'll bet when coke becomes legal soon, everyone will want Tegridy Cocaine!
"
23,10,Stephen,"Well, only one thing left to do, gang. Let's go driving!
"
23,10,All,"Yeah! 
"
23,10,Announcer 2,"All-natural Tegridy Cocaine. Endorsed and approved by Santa Claus. Available soon at a store near you.
