22,1,Mrs. Nelson,"I want you all to take a close look at your math exams, children. Some of you did very well, but many of you did not. 
"
22,1,Cartman,"Oh, man!
"
22,1,Mrs. Nelson," The addition of fractions is very simple. Let's run through it again. How do we solve this first one? 
"
22,1,Butters," Add together the three and the three.
"
22,1,Mrs. Nelson," Good, Butters, we add the three's together.  And what about the four's? Tolkien?
"
22,1,Tolkien,"They're the denominators, so they stay a four.
"
22,1,Cartman,"Wait, wait, Tolkien got an A? But I cheated off Tolkien!
"
22,1,Mrs. Nelson,"Ah, I can't hear you, Eric.
"
22,1,Cartman,"I said something's wrong! I got an F, but I cheated off Tolkien!
"
22,1,SWAT officer 1," Active shooter! Active shooter! 
"
22,1,Mrs. Nelson,"And now we divide, right?! Craig, how about you?! What are we dividing?!
"
22,1,SWAT officer 1," Active shooter! Active shooter!
"
22,1,Craig,"Divide four by six? 
"
22,1,Mrs. Nelson,"The four by the six?!
"
22,1,SWAT officer 1,"Unit 5 in southwest classroom! 
"
22,1,Mrs. Nelson,"Or the six by the four?!
"
22,1,Kyle,"The six by the four!
"
22,1,SWAT officer 1,"Southwest classroom, clear! 
"
22,1,Mrs. Nelson,"Now we're gonna retake the exam on Friday.
"
22,1,Class,"AWWW!
"
22,1,SWAT officer 2,"Shooter's in the hallway! All units report! 
"
22,1,Mrs. Nelson,"Now I'm giving you an opportunity to do better. I hope you take advantage of it.
"
22,1,SWAT officer," Put down the gun, son. You don't wanna do this.
"
22,1,Cartman,"You can see where Tolkien erased his answers and wrote down the right ones! He did it to me on purpose! 
"
22,1,Mrs. Nelson,"Eric, that's enough!  Now let's move on to the next equation.
"
22,1,Cartman,"That is such bullshit, you guys! Tolkien knew I was cheating off him, so he deliberately put down the wrong answers! Why would he do that?!
"
22,1,Stan,"I flunked that test too. I don't understand fractions - they don't make any sense.
"
22,1,Cartman,"That's not the point, you guys! Why is Tolkien out to get me? There's something going on here.
"
22,1,Bill Keegan,"Another school shooting today has left students in shock and disbelief.
"
22,1,Kyle,"Yeah, Tolkien's probably sick of you cheating off him all the time.
"
22,1,Cartman,"But why now? That's the question, Kyle. I always cheat off Tolkien. Why did he choose now to hurt me?
"
22,1,Sharon," Stanley, oh my God!  Baby! Oh, you're okay!
"
22,1,Stan,"Uh, hey, Mom.
"
22,1,Sharon,"It's all right, Stanley. We're gonna go home and talk about this with your dad. And we will get through this as a family!  Come on, get in the car!
"
22,1,Cartman,"Dude, what's up Stan's mom's ass?
"
22,1,Sharon,"Stanley? Well? Do you wanna tell your father about what happened at school today?
"
22,1,Stan," Um... Oh- Oh, I... flunked my math quiz.
"
22,1,Sharon,"Noo, the other thing!
"
22,1,Randy," What other thing?  What happened at school today?
"
22,1,Stan," Oh, the school shooting?
"
22,1,Sharon,"Yes, the school shooting!
"
22,1,Stan,"Oh, yeah, some kid shot up the school.
"
22,1,Randy,"Who shot up the schoo-  was it you?
"
22,1,Stan,"No.
"
22,1,Randy,"Did you get shot?
"
22,1,Stan,"No.
"
22,1,Randy,"Oh...  Well, what's this about failing a math quiz?
"
22,1,Sharon," Are you serious?! Did you not hear what your child said?! Kids died at his school!
"
22,1,Randy,"I'm sorry, Sharon. I...
"
22,1,Sharon,"Why are you all acting like this is normal? What is wrong with you people?! 
"
22,1,Stan,"What's up Mom's ass?
"
22,1,Randy," Hey, Sharon, ya... doin' okay?
"
22,1,Sharon,"No, I'm not okay! Children were shot! They were killed at a school where they were supposed to be safe!
"
22,1,Randy,"Uh huh, and... what else is goin' on?
"
22,1,Sharon," Why does there need to be anything else?! Are you kidding me?!
"
22,1,Randy," I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Sharon.
"
22,1,Sharon,"Why isn't anyone else emotional?!
"
22,1,Randy,"...Hun, uh...  When was your last...? I mean, you know how sometimes things can seem like a little bigger deal 'cause you know, your... down there?
"
22,1,Sharon,"Don't you dare suggest that I'm only emotional because it's-
"
22,1,Randy,"I mean, I'm just, I'm just pointing out that it is around that time.
"
22,1,Sharon,"GET OUT, RANDY! I'M NOT OVERREACTING!
"
22,1,Randy,"Okay. Okay, love you, honey. I'll leave you alone.  Welp, another three days of this, probably. 
"
22,1,PC Principal,"I understand that there have been some problems here at the school lately. A lot of students are experiencing anxiety, and Eric Cartman just wanted to be able to voice his concerns. Go ahead, Eric. 
"
22,1,Cartman,"Tolkien,  There are some terrible things that I realize you might have heard from the other kids here at school. There are some rumors that have been going around, about me, that... that I thought Black Panther was a terrible movie. There's rumors that I said it was a structural mess. You know, that the rhinos were really stupid. I want to assure you that I never said anything like that. I loved Black Panther. So if, you know, you feel like there's a need to come after me, to get back at me, I just need you to know that people are lying, because I like Black Panther just as much as you did. I am not a racist.
"
22,1,Tolkien,"I actually never saw Black Panther.
"
22,1,Cartman," Say what, girlfriend? Whatchoo talkin' 'bout, Willis? Come on, Raj! You never saw Black Panther??
"
22,1,Tolkien,"No, I didn't see it.
"
22,1,Cartman,"But I thought all of you saw it. 
"
22,1,Mr. Mackey,"I got this one.  All right, everyone, get down! Everybody get the fuck down!
"
22,1,Cartman,"Tolkien, let's be honest with each other, okay? Why else would you manipulate my test grades?
"
22,1,PC Principal,"How exactly did Tolkien manipulate your grades, Eric? 
"
22,1,Cartman,"There was a test. I should have got an A on it, but Tolkien did things to make me fail, and it's not fair.
"
22,1,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, m'kay, who's shootin' up the school?
"
22,1,PC Principal,"Is that true, Tolkien? Did you do somethin' to make Eric fail a test?
"
22,1,Tolkien," I didn't make him fail, no!
"
22,1,Cartman,"You didn't make me fail the test and you didn't see Black Panther. Right.
"
22,1,Mr. Mackey,"Everyone down!
"
22,1,An officer,"Active shooter, active shooter!
"
22,1,Cartman,"I mean, I mean, this is ridiculous.
"
22,1,Mr. Mackey," Over this way! Into the cafeteria! Right over there, m'kay- No, you shot the wrong one!
"
22,1,Sharon,"Thanks for coming, everybody. I'm sure you all heard there was yet another school shooting today. We have to figure out what we're going to do as parents because this whole thing is out of control!  We have to ask ourselves why this is happening and do something now!
"
22,1,Stephen,"Well, you know, Sharon, I think... its a complex issue, you know. It's... it's not really as simple as just...  What I'm saying is that, that with issues like this, sometimes you have to be kind of...  crazy? 
"
22,1,Sharon,"What are you talking about?  Do you understand that our children are being murdered?
"
22,1,Stephen,"Red?
"
22,1,Sharon,"How much closer to home can this all hit?  It was at our children's school!
"
22,1,Stephen," Crazy time. Crazy red time. 
"
22,1,Randy,"I agree with my wife.
"
22,1,Laura,"Well, there certainly are things that need changing. Just yesterday, I was at the park with my son Craig and... have you seen the state of the playground equipment? Not only does it seem unsafe, but it's become quite an eyesore.
"
22,1,Ryan,"The whole park could use an upgrade, if you ask me. It's become a campout for the homeless.
"
22,1,Sharon," ARE YOU FUCKING JOKING?! YOU'RE GONNA TAKE ONE SECOND TO COMPARE CHILD MURDER TO PARK UPGRADES?! WHAT IS WRONG WITH EVERYBODY?! YOU'VE ALL GONE CRAZY!! 
"
22,1,Randy,"...Anybody need a drink?
"
22,1,Cartman," Butters. 
"
22,1,Butters,"Waaah!  Ah! Uh-oh!  Hey Eric.
"
22,1,Cartman,"Butters, I need help. My mom says if I flunk another math test, she's gonna ground me from playing Fortnite.
"
22,1,Butters,"Oh, Jeez, want me to help you study?
"
22,1,Cartman,"No, dumbass, I need to get some dirt on Tolkien so he stops punishing me for what I supposedly said about Black Panther.
"
22,1,Butters,"Oho, Black Panther? Well that was a great movie! 
"
22,1,Cartman,"No it wasn't. But now listen.  There's got to be something Tolkien wouldn't want people to know. Something I can use as leverage.
"
22,1,Butters,"Well, what do you want me to do? I got hall monitor duty.
"
22,1,Cartman,"Just ask around. If you find any dirt on Tolkien, give me a call.
"
22,1,Butters,"Okay, Eric. 
"
22,1,Cartman," This world is full of two types of people:  the ones who are honest, and the ones who don't play by the rules.  Tolkien's got everyone believing he's the one African-American in the entire country who didn't see Black Panther. What else is he lying about? 
"
22,1,Randy," It just gets so hard, you know?  Everything's going fine, and then at a certain time of the month I have to start walking on eggshells.
"
22,1,Stephen,"It's all right, Randy.
"
22,1,Randy,"It's just. it's just once I'd like her to acknowledge it, you know? Just once say ""You know, maybe I was overreacting a little bit 'cause of my hormones.""
"
22,1,Sharon," Randy, they announced on the news there's been another school shooting in Jefferson County!
"
22,1,Randy," Okay, Sharon. Cool.
"
22,1,Sharon,"What is ""cool"" about that?!
"
22,1,Randy,"Nuh-nothing. I love you, sweetheart.
"
22,1,Sharon,"GOD! 
"
22,1,Randy,"I don't know. I don't know how much more of this I can take. It's like, I turn on the TV and dread they'll say something about a school shooting because it's gonna set my wife off.
"
22,1,Stephen,"Well, Randy, have you stopped to think that maybe this problem is bigger than Sharon's period?
"
22,1,Randy," What... what do you mean?
"
22,1,Stephen,"I mean that maybe what's going on really is a big deal. What if this is actually... menopause?
"
22,1,Randy,"Menopause? I don't even know what that is.
"
22,1,Paramedic," Well you see, Mr. Marsh, when the woman's ovaries actually stop producing eggs, it's a significant change. It's this ending of the menstrual cycle in a woman's life that we call menopause.
"
22,1,Randy,"Uh huh. But... if a woman isn't having periods anymore, then why would she still overreact and be bitchy?
"
22,1,Paramedic,"Well actually, menopause is one of the most severely hormonal times a woman ever goes through. It's good you sought the advice of a medical professional, because the changes in your wife's body are gonna be confusing and at times hard to cope with.
"
22,1,Randy,"Well wait, you're saying this could actually get worse?
"
22,1,Paramedic,"I'm afraid so.  Ah, no. Dead ones go in the other truck.  You see Mr. Marsh, menopause is almost like a super period, and it's been known to last... for up to two years.
"
22,1,Randy," Oh my God!
"
22,1,Cartman," Nichole, can I talk to ya? 
"
22,1,Nichole,"'Bout what?
"
22,1,Cartman,"Word on the street is you and Tolkien are back together.
"
22,1,Nichole,"We're trying, just talking a lot and seeing if we can work things out.
"
22,1,Cartman,"Why did you break up with him? What did he do to you?
"
22,1,Nichole,"That's... really none of your business. 
"
22,1,Cartman," He didn't take you to see Black Panther with him, did he? That must have really stung.
"
22,1,Nichole,"I don't know what you're talking about.
"
22,1,Cartman,"Oh no? When you guys talk about how sweet Black Panther was, what's he say?
"
22,1,Nichole,"We've never talked about it.
"
22,1,Cartman,"Right. You two guys just hang out and talk, and Black Panther never comes up. Why are you covering for Tolkien? What's he have on you?
"
22,1,Nichole," I gotta get to class.
"
22,1,Cartman," $1.3 billion domestic box office, a milestone for African Americans,  and I'm supposed to believe that Tolkien and his little sex kitten never even talked about it.  The all-school test is in less than 72 hours. Unless there's a connection, I'll be grounded from Fortnite for weeks. 
"
22,1,Cartman,"Hello, Mom and Dad.
"
22,1,Sharon,"I keep thinking... When will be the time when I get the call? You know? When will I answer the phone and find out my son, my daughter, were... killed? At school?
"
22,1,Doctor,"Mmmhmm. Yeah I see.
"
22,1,Sharon,"I live in constant fear that I won't be there to protect my children when something happens to them.
"
22,1,Doctor,"Well, Sharon, have you maybe considered that your feelings are partly due to... handkerchief balls?
"
22,1,Sharon,"What? 
"
22,1,Doctor,"Handkerchief balls. Handkerchief out the balls.  Red handkerchief.  No- no more handkerchief. No more- no more red. Zero. Empty. Old lady.
"
22,1,Sharon,"What I'm saying is that I'm so overwhelmed that I-
"
22,1,Doctor,"Old lady, where's my dick?  Where's my dick?
"
22,1,Sharon,"What the hell are you talking about?! I don't understand!  God damnit!  Stop acting like there's something wrong with me! Something's wrong with you! All of you! Try having some God-damned compassion! 
"
22,1,Cartman,"Yeah. yeah yeah, I know. You know, my other favorite part was when Black Panther had those dreams about his dead father. I mean the dad, the tribal leader, speaking to the new king about being a good leader. I've never seen a movie do that before, except for Lion King, of course, but Black Panther was so original.
"
22,1,Steve,"We enjoyed it, yes.
"
22,1,Cartman,"So, uh, what was Tolkien's favorite part of Black Panther?
"
22,1,Linda Black,"Tolkien?
"
22,1,Cartman,"Yeah. You must have all had some deep family talks about it. What does Tolkien say about it on Black Panther Family Discussion Night? 
"
22,1,Tolkien,"Get out of my house!
"
22,1,Cartman,"Tolkien.
"
22,1,Tolkien,"Come on, get out! 
"
22,1,Cartman,"Sure thing. You know, we were just talking about how your family did see Black Panther.
"
22,1,Steve,"Oh, no not the family. Tolkien's mom and I saw it on date night. We're gonna watch it again with Tolkien, though. We don't let him watch it alone because it's PG-13.
"
22,1,Cartman,"Well, I guess there's nothing more to it, then. Nice talking to you folks.  Eh, you know, just one last thing. If you ever found out your son saw a PG-13 movie without you, you'd probably be pretty pissed off.
"
22,1,Linda,"Well, Tolkien wouldn't do that.
"
22,1,Cartman,"No. No, he'd have no reason to falsely claim he's the only one who hasn't seen Black Panther.  I'll see you at school.
"
22,1,Harriet Biggle,"Sharon, Sharon, you have to come quick!
"
22,1,Sharon,"What is it?
"
22,1,Linda Stotch,"There's another shooting happening at the school right now!
"
22,1,Harriet,"It just started. Maybe we can make it in time!
"
22,1,Sharon,"Oh my God! 
"
22,1,Sharon,"Come on, we have to hurry!
"
22,1,Linda,"No, Sharon. You go ahead first.
"
22,1,Sharon,"Why??
"
22,1,Harriet,"You just- ya-you should go. 
"
22,1,Sharon,"What the fuck is going on? 
"
22,1,Randy,"
Where do I begin
To tell the story of how great a love can be?

 Surprise, Sharon

The sweet love story that is older than the sea...


"
22,1,Cartman,"Oh hay, man. The big math quiz is about to start. You gonna let me cheat off you?
"
22,1,Tolkien,"Nnnope.
"
22,1,Cartman,"You saw Black Panther without your parents' permission. I typed up all my findings, Tolkien. I made ten copies and put them in envelopes. If I don't pass this math quiz, the envelopes are all set to be sent to ten different news organizations.
"
22,1,Tolkien,"You did all that instead of actually studying for the test?
"
22,1,Cartman,"So, what's it gonna be, Tolkien? You can be mad I didn't like Black Panther, but you can't take it out on me anymore.
"
22,1,Tolkien,"I didn't see Black Panther.
"
22,1,Cartman,"Then I guess your parents won't be mad when they read my report.
"
22,1,Cartman,"In poker they call it a bluff. I know that right now, Tolkien is shitting his pants. All I need to do now is wait for the poop to stink.
"
22,1,Randy,"
She fills my heart with very special things.
With angel songs, with wild imaginings
She f-


"
22,1,Cartman,"Tolkien, we are running out of time. If you don't let me cheat off you, I'm going to tell your parents that you saw Black Panther in the theater without them!
"
22,1,Tolkien,"I didn't see Black Panther in the theater!
"
22,1,Cartman,"Of course you did, Tolkien! That's why me ripping on it pissed you off so much!
"
22,1,Tolkien,"I swear on my mother's life, I don't care what you said about Black Panther! Goodbye! 
"
22,1,Cartman,"But Tolkien, I don't understand! If you didn't see it, and you really don't care that I ripped on Black Panther, then why would you let me cheat-  Oh my God. You don't care what I said because you did see it... and you... didn't like it either.  That's what this is all about, isn't it? You hate yourself for seeing through the mirage like I did, and that's why you wouldn't let me cheat off you! Well I didn't write Black Panther, Tolkien! It isn't my fault it sucked! Why go after me?! But now, it's over. Don't worry. They're not gonna know you didn't like Black Panther, so long as... you never make me fail another math test.
"
22,1,Tolkien," Well, we're probably both gonna fail now because fourth period already started. 
"
22,1,Cartman,"What? No!  We have to take that test, Tolkien! 
"
22,1,Cartman,"Come on! We can still get to class on time!  Oh, great! Come on, we can do this!  Billy, give me your lunchbox!  Butters!
"
22,1,Butters,"Wull it's the entire glee club this time!
"
22,1,Cartman,"Butters, I have to get to class! The math quiz is starting!
"
22,1,Butters,"Oh crap! The math quiz? It's already fourth period?
"
22,1,Cartman,"I can't flunk this math quiz, Butters! Cover me!
"
22,1,Butters,"Well okay!  Waaaahahaaaaaagh!
"
22,1,Cartman," Yeah, kewll!
"
22,1,Randy,"How long does it last?
"
22,1,Officer Stevens,"You did everything you could, Mr. Marsh. If your wife can't realize the truth and appreciate you, maybe she never will.
"
22,1,Sharon,"Realize what?! What have you been telling everybody, RANDY?!
"
22,1,Stephen,"Randy was just trying to make you feel loved while you're going through menopause.
"
22,1,Sharon,"Menopause?! I'm not going through fucking menopause!
"
22,1,Stephen,"How do you know?
"
22,1,Sharon,"I just got my period this morning!
"
22,1,Randy,"You... you got your period?
"
22,1,Sharon,"YES!
"
22,1,Randy,"You just got your period this morning?
"
22,1,Sharon,"YES!
"
22,1,Randy,"Soooo the past few days, maybe you have been just a liiittle-
"
22,1,Sharon,"NO! NO NOTHING! Don't you guys see what's happened here?! I want you to be angry! Every day we hear about another school shooting! It used to be a big deal! I want it to be a big deal again. I mean Harriet, you came to my house and said there was a school shooting to trick me into going with you!
"
22,1,Harriet,"I was just trying to be a part of the big surprise, Sharon.
"
22,1,Sharon ,"That's what I'm talking about! That's crazy, Harriet! I want you all to be shocked! I want you all to be sad!
"
22,1,Townsman,"You want everyone to be sad?
"
22,1,Harriet,"Well. Sharon, if you wanted to make me sad, congratulations.  You did a great job. 
"
22,1,Stephen,"Yeah, let's go somewhere without so much negativity. 
"
22,1,Randy,"Aw guys, uh she didn't mean it! She just... get, give her a... 
"
22,1,Mrs. Nelson,"The quiz is multiple-choice, but be sure to show all your work. You'll have 20 minutes to complete your answers. All right, your time starts... now. 
"
22,1,Cartman," Everybody has dirty laundry. All it takes to find it is getting a little dirty yourself. The only question now is, how many Tolkiens are out there? How many others are afraid to say that Black Panther wasn't all that sweet because of the damage it could do to them?
"
22,1,Cartman,"What do you mean?
"
22,1,Cartman," I mean, in a school of 200 students, there's already two who are covering up the truth. All Tolkien is doing by letting you cheat off him is keeping the whole thing quiet even longer.  There are others out there... and even if it means failing, I'm their only damn hope.
"
22,1,Sharon,"Randy...  we need to talk.
"
22,1,Randy,"Sure, honey.
"
22,1,Sharon,"There's been... too much pain and suffering, and... it has to stop.
"
22,1,Randy,"I know, sweetheart, I know.
"
22,1,Sharon,"What I'm trying to say is... I've been very emotional lately, and... maybe... maybe I do overreact sometimes.
"
22,1,Randy," Aaaaah?
"
22,1,Sharon,"Maybe I need to realize that my emotions can be hormonal and not just take things out on you.
"
22,1,Randy,"Aaah? Aaaaah?
"
22,1,Sharon,"Randy, I'm... sorry.
"
22,1,Randy,"Aaaah. Aaaaaah.  Thank you, Sharon. I don't know what it's like to have periods, but I'll try to be more understanding from now on. 
"
22,1,Sharon,"Sorry, sorry, one second.  Hello? Yes. What? Oh my God! Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay. Okay. 
"
22,1,Randy,"What is it?
"
22,1,Sharon,"There's been another school shooting. Stan's been shot.
"
22,1,Randy,"Shuh-should we get down there?
"
22,1,Sharon," It's not the end of the world. 
"
22,1,Randy," Aaaaah. I love you, Sharon. 
"
22,2,Randy,"Come on, guys, we don't wanna be late!
"
22,2,Stan," Do I have to go? It's the only day I get to play games.
"
22,2,Randy,"We're all going. Come on! 
"
22,2,Stan," ...Don't understand why we have to go to church every Sunday.
"
22,2,Randy,"Church is important, Stan. Way more important than video games and TV. Church is about community and coming together. A lot of things.
"
22,2,Sharon,"All I know is that after church I feel better.
"
22,2,Randy,"Yeah. Me too.
"
22,2,Randy,"Hey, mornin' Stephen, Linda.
"
22,2,Stephen," Morning, guys.
"
22,2,Townsman,"Aww thanks there, Randy.
"
22,2,Randy,"You got it- hey, where's Josie?
"
22,2,Townsman,"Oh, she slipped her disc in her neck. Poor thing can barely move.
"
22,2,Randy,"Aw, she's gonna miss church? That's too bad. Give her my best. 
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi,"For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son,  so that whoever believed in him should have eternal life. This is the Gospel of the Lord.
"
22,2,Congregants,"Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ. 
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi," Today's gospel talks about what the Lord has to give us. He did so because we could not control our temptations.
"
22,2,Randy,"Kind of like a priest in a room full of naked boys. 
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi,"Uh Okay, okay, let's, let's try and have none of that today. In John 3:16, the Gospel tells us how God so loved the world he gave to us his only Son
"
22,2,Stephen,"And a Catholic priest raped him. 
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi,"Okay, okay, Co-come on guys, Nu-now, what greater gift could the Lord has given to us?
"
22,2,Woman,"Children's underwear which priests couldn't pull down so easily? 
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi,"Okay, let's, let's try to compose ourselves. Let's try and just get through this first one, okay guys? What does it mean that the Lord gave us his only begotten Son?
"
22,2,Townsman 1,"It means that if you're a cute boy at a Catholic priest's swimming party you'd better be gettin'! 
"
22,2,Randy,"Oh, that was a great one, Nelson. Salvation in a little boy's mouth. I'm gonna post that one for sure.
"
22,2,Woman 2,"Who said the thing about naked boy salad?
"
22,2,Stephen,"Oh that was Linda!
"
22,2,Jimbo,"Well, see ya next week, everybody! 
"
22,2,Others,"Yeah, see ya! See ya! Bye.
"
22,2,Stan,"I really don't understand the point of all that.
"
22,2,Randy," Yeah, well, I used to think that about church when I was a kid too.
"
22,2,Stan,"But back then I don't know if church was that stupid.
"
22,2,Randy,"Hey, don't say things like that, Stan! You wanna go to fuckin' Hell?
"
22,2,Butters,"Father, can I talk to you?
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi,"Oh, of course, my child. What's troubling you?
"
22,2,Butters,"Well, what's troubling you?  You know, at school the kids used to all make fun of me sometimes. One kid would say something mean, a-and then the other kids would laugh. I know how lousy it feels. I learned to just walk away, not give 'em all the satisfaction.
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi,"Well, we can't all walk away. The-the priesthood is all I know. I, I dedicated my entire life to it. Ah I don't know anything else.
"
22,2,Butters,"I know it seems impossible. I thought I'd be a punching bag my whole life, but now, I'm one of the popular kids. I even get invited to board game night at Stan's house. My point is, sometimes, y-you just gotta put yourself out there.
"
22,2,Cartman,"I wanna be Calamity Jane this time.
"
22,2,Stan,"How many cards do you start with, Kenny?
"
22,2,Kenny,"(Two cards.) 
"
22,2,Kyle,"Oh, there's Butters!
"
22,2,Butters," Oh hey, fellas. I hope you don't mind I brought a friend. Come on in. 
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi,"Uh, hello, my children. 
"
22,2,Stan,"Okay, so I-I guess I'm gonna go to the saloon and try to arrest Cartman.
"
22,2,Cartman,"Let's see what you got, bitch.
"
22,2,Butters,"So, Kyle, did you know Father is a really good singer? You like to sing too, don't you?
"
22,2,Kyle,"No.
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi,"Praise the Lord, for the Lord is good. Sing praise to his name, for that is pleasant.
"
22,2,Cartman,"Ace. You lose. 
"
22,2,Randy," Hey Stan,  have you seen my-  No way!  Hang on! Hang on! I gotta post this!
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi," Uh, I shouldn't be here.
"
22,2,Randy,"This is hilarious!  Four boys and a priest playing a board game!
"
22,2,Butters,"Aw, Father, wait a-
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi,"I should go.
"
22,2,Randy,"Nononoait, let me get the picture. 
"
22,2,Butters,"Father! 
"
22,2,Randy,"Aw shit, I missed it!
"
22,2,Cartman,"Ugh.  Why did you invite Butters to game night?
"
22,2,Stan,"I didn't invite him. 
"
22,2,Butters,"Come on, Father, you can't give up so fast.
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi,"This is just gonna make things way worse. People will rip on me.
"
22,2,Butters,"Who cares? Who cares what people say?
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi,"I do.
"
22,2,Butters,"Aw, come on, you gotta be strong!
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi," Why do you care?!
"
22,2,Butters,"Because I was you. Okay? I wasn't always this cool. I've been through it. But then one day, somebody told me something. He said ""life is full of love and light and bountiful things,"" and you know who told me that? You did! Two years ago, in church! You have a right to go and be happy! And if people wanna keep tryin' to knock you down, well, fuck 'em!
"
22,2,Randy,"Hey, mornin' Mackey!
"
22,2,Mr. Mackey,"Well Happy Sunday! Mornin' Ted, Hazel.
"
22,2,Ted,"Mornin'.
"
22,2,Hazel,"Morning.
"
22,2,Others,"Morning. 
"
22,2,Randy,"Ah, doin' better, huh, Josie?
"
22,2,Josie,"A lot better. Thank you.
"
22,2,Randy,"All right.  Huh. What the?  It's not open.
"
22,2,Ryan,"Let me try. 
"
22,2,Randy,"Hey! Hey, it's nine o'clock! Hey!
"
22,2,Woman,"What's going on? 
"
22,2,Randy," Ohhh! 
"
22,2,Butters,"There's no church today! You all are just gonna have to find some'n' better to do! 
"
22,2,Randy,"Hey...  Hey, open the door! Hey, come on! 
"
22,2,Randy,"Well this sucks. What are we supposed to do without church?
"
22,2,Sharon,"I just feel so empty.
"
22,2,Shelley,"What are you guys so upset about?
"
22,2,Randy,"Shut up, Shelley!
"
22,2,Butters,"Isn't this great, Father? Fresh mountain air, a nice warm fire, a nice warm fire.
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi,"I have to admit it's a pretty nice way to spend a Sunday. How many are your works, Lord? In wisdom you made them all.
"
22,2,Butters,"Yeah, the Lord is pretty cool.
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi,"He is. Because he brought me you.
"
22,2,Archbishop,"Denver archdiocese. The Lord be with you.
"
22,2,Mr. Mackey," And with your spirit, m'kay? Uh, oh my name is Counselor Mackey, and w-uh we seem to be havin' a little problem with our local church here in South Park. Our uh... our priest has gone missing.
"
22,2,Archbishop," Oh, not another one!  All right, listen to me carefully. Your local priest has not done anything wrong. He's probably just taking some time off. Why is that suspicious?
"
22,2,Mr. Mackey,"Well, it's not suspicious, we just kind of don't know what to do, you know? Uh.
"
22,2,Archbishop,"We'll take care of it. There's no need to involve the authorities. Just sit tight.  Send in a clean-up crew now!  We've got another one. A priest on South Park has gone rogue and is probably out doing his thing. I need you guys to get up there and clean up his mess.
"
22,2,Auxiliary,"Don't worry, Your Holiness. By the time we're done with that town there won't be a lick of cum anywhere.
"
22,2,Butters,"Happy birthday, Clyde!  Hope you don't mind I brought a friend.
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi,"For we are God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works.
"
22,2,Clyde,"Dude, what are you talking about?!
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi,"Come on, Father. Let's go tear up the skating rink. 
"
22,2,Kyle,"Just leave it alone, Clyde. Butters brings him everywhere.
"
22,2,Clyde,"I don't care, I don't want a priest at my fucking birthday party!
"
22,2,Cartman," It's all right, Clyde, it's all right.
"
22,2,Butters,"That's it! You're doing great!
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi,"Uh-ah. Oh, Mother Mary. I feel like everyone's staring at me. 
"
22,2,Butters,"Nobody's staring. I'm gonna get us some soda pop. You just mingle with the other fellas!
"
22,2,Randy,"What's it all about, huh? Are we just bags of carbon and water put on this planet for no purpose? You're born, you die, then you're just... food for the worms.
"
22,2,Stuart,"It all does seem pretty meaningless.
"
22,2,Townsman 2," Hey, the church is back open! There are people inside!
"
22,2,Jimbo,"What?
"
22,2,Randy,"The church is back open?
"
22,2,Townsman 3,"Oh boy! Let's go let's go let's go let's go!
"
22,2,Others,"The church is back open! Thank God! Let's go!
"
22,2,Auxiliary,"Scrub everything! Police can detect even a milligram of cum and rectal blood!
"
22,2,Randy," Hey!
"
22,2,Auxiliary,"Oh uh, hello my children. The Lord be with you.
"
22,2,Townsmen,"And with your spirit.
"
22,2,Randy,"What uh, what are you guys doing?
"
22,2,Auxiliary,"Oh, we're just giving the place a nice scrub down while we wait for your priest to come back. He was called to South America last week.
"
22,2,Randy,"Last week? No, he was at my house a couple of days ago playing board games with the boys.
"
22,2,Auxiliary," No he wasn't. Look, I assure you everything is fine. Your priest will be back. Just have some patience.
"
22,2,Townsmen,"Awww.
"
22,2,Townsman 4,"Come on, guys. 
"
22,2,Auxiliary,"Scrub everything. Bleach those board-game pieces. You find something on that chair?
"
22,2,Priest,"It's either blood and cum, or ketchup and mayo. 
"
22,2,Auxiliary,"Well, just get rid of it. Bleach the entire top of the table. That's probably where he mounted them.
"
22,2,Stan," Uh, excuse me.
"
22,2,Auxiliary," Oh. Hello, my son.
"
22,2,Stan,"What are you doing?
"
22,2,Auxiliary,"What are we doing about what?
"
22,2,Stan,"Well, I mean, it looks like you're scrubbing and bleaching our tables and chairs.
"
22,2,Auxiliary,"Mmm mmm, that's not what's going on. Your local priest was never here, actually.
"
22,2,Stan,"Yeah he was. I played with him.
"
22,2,Auxiliary,"Oh, you did!  Better get the Kumby. 
"
22,2,Stan,"What's a Kumby?
"
22,2,Auxiliary,"We're just here to cleanse your spirit, my child.
"
22,2,Priest," Praise be to Christ. 
"
22,2,Boys,"Yaaay!
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi,"And now let us pray.
"
22,2,Boys,"Awww.
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi,"Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts. which we are about to receive.
"
22,2,Clyde,"Kyle, will you do something please?!
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi," He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens...
"
22,2,Kyle,"Why me?
"
22,2,Cartman," Kyle!
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi,"...through Christ our Lord. Amen.
"
22,2,Kyle," Uh, Butters, can I talk to you really fast?
"
22,2,Butters,"Wow! Sure, Kyle. Be right back, Father. 
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi,"All right, my child.
"
22,2,Butters,"Huh-what's up?
"
22,2,Kyle,"Butters, you know, you can just bring your priest with you everywhere. I mean, sometimes the guys just wanna do stuff and not have a priest around.
"
22,2,Butters,"What are you saying, Kyle?
"
22,2,Kyle,"I'm saying it's just kind of awkward, Butters.  He's bumming everybody out. Nobody wants to hear about Jesus at a birthday party.
"
22,2,Butters,"Well, of course, you don't.
"
22,2,Kyle,"It's not just me. It's everyone, Butters. He can try all he wants, but he just doesn't belong here. 
"
22,2,Butters,"Well I'm sorry for tryin' to help out somebody who didn't have anywhere else to turn. We'll both just leave. I thought you were better than that, Kyle. 
"
22,2,Auxiliary,"All right, clean and scrub everything. I want it spotless! Get any evidence the priest might have left behind.
"
22,2,Assistant,"There's something over here,  but I can't tell if it's cum or frosting.
"
22,2,Auxiliary,"It's an 8-year-old's birthday party. Of course, it's cum. Get the Kumby!
"
22,2,Priest," Praise be to Christ.
"
22,2,Auxiliary," Hello, young man. We're looking for your town priest. Was he here?
"
22,2,Cartman,"Yeah, but he left with Butters.
"
22,2,Auxiliary,"Tell me about this Butters.
"
22,2,Clyde,"All right, that does it!  Get out of my birthday party or else I'm gonna call the police! 
"
22,2,Butters,"Father! Father? Has anybody seen my priest? Father, where'd you go?  There you are! I've been looking everywhere.
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi,"Just leave me alone.
"
22,2,Butters,"But you're missin' the party!
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi,"Look, your friends are right, okay? I don't belong there. I, I don't belong anywhere. 
"
22,2,Butters," But, they just don't understand you like I do.
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi,"Stop defending me! There are things you don't know!
"
22,2,Butters,"But it's not your fault.
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi,"Yes it is! It is my fault!
"
22,2,Butters,"Why?!
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi," Because I knew, all right?! I knew! Years ago, when bad things started coming out about the Catholic Church, I went to the Vatican and ... I found out that the problem was worse than anyone even thought. I thought I could help fix it, so, I kept my mouth shut. I thought there was cancer in the Church that we could get rid of. But the Church is cancer. It's not about a few bad apples. There are only a few good apples, and I'm clearly not one of them. So just stay away from me!
"
22,2,Butters,"But... I thought we were pals.
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi,"You thought wrong. 
"
22,2,Auxiliary,"Hey. Hey there. What's the matter, my child? Did you know that Jesus loves you?
"
22,2,Butters,"Sometimes I wonder.
"
22,2,Auxiliary,"""And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me.""  Want a Three Musketeers?
"
22,2,Butters,"...No thanks.
"
22,2,Auxiliary,"You like camping trips? You wanna go camping?
"
22,2,Butters,"No.
"
22,2,Auxiliary,"I got a bunny in the back. You wanna see the bunny?
"
22,2,Butters," Well, okay!  Stan?
"
22,2,Stan,"I have no idea what's going on.
"
22,2,Clyde,"Worst birthday ever! 
"
22,2,Randy,"Boring  Dumb.  Stupid.  Good, but dated in its view of gender norms.  Wugh. 
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi,"Hello, Mr. Marsh.
"
22,2,Randy,"Father!  Hey, hey Sharon, it's Father!
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi,"M, Mr. Marsh-
"
22,2,Randy,"He's back!
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi,"-please.
"
22,2,Randy,"Hey, Father's back!
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi,"I'm just going around trying to locate little Butters Stotch. I thought he might be here playing a board game with your son?
"
22,2,Randy,"Oh uh, no. I haven't seen, Butters. Or Stan. But Father, please, we all need church.
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi,"I'm sorry, but I have to keep looking.  I said some terrible things.
"
22,2,Randy,"Please, Father, we're all lost, and the cleanup crew hasn't helped at all.
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi," What cleanup crew?
"
22,2,Auxiliary,"Any sign of him?
"
22,2,Assistant,"No, but this should draw him out. The cute one says it's where he and the priest first got together.
"
22,2,Auxiliary,"All right, when the priest gets here, we'll take care of him and then eradicate this place of any evidence.
"
22,2,Priest,"Should I bring out the Kumby?
"
22,2,Auxiliary,"No, this is gonna be a bigger job than that. Bring out... the Kumboni. 
"
22,2,Stephen,"Hey Randy, what's up?
"
22,2,Randy," Stephen! Stephen, listen! The boys are missing! Fr. Maxi thinks they've been taken by the other priests!
"
22,2,Stephen," Taken by priests?? Should we call the police or buy some condoms? 
"
22,2,Randy," Okay. Okay-okay, that was good.  But seriously, we have to find these guys! The boys are in danger!
"
22,2,Stephen,"But where would priests go this late at night?
"
22,2,Linda,"To a midnight sale at Boys 'R' Us?
"
22,2,Randy,"What-what'd she say?
"
22,2,Stephen,"She said, ""To a midnight sale at Boys 'R' Us.""
"
22,2,Randy,"Can, can I post that?
"
22,2,Stephen,"Sure, she doesn't care.
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi," Give me that! Mr. Stotch, have you heard from Butters at all?!
"
22,2,Stephen,"Well yeah, we got a really weird text from him saying not to worry, he needed to do some camping.
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi," Oh my Lord. I know where to go. And when we get there... I'll need to go in alone.
"
22,2,Randy,"Yeah I'll bet. 
"
22,2,Assistant,"He's not showing up.
"
22,2,Auxiliary,"Try the priest call. 
"
22,2,Kid's voice,"I love Jeeesus! I love Jeeesus!
"
22,2,Assistant," I don't think he's coming.
"
22,2,Auxiliary,"Oh he's coming all right. Just not here. Let's start packing up. You.  Get on the Kumboni and eradicate this place along with everything in it.
"
22,2,Priest,"Yes, your Holiness.
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi,"Wait! 
"
22,2,Butters,"Father.
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi,"You wanted to find me? Well, here I am. I know why you're here. The Church can't have... someone like me going around making it look bad. So go ahead.  Do it. Just get it over with.
"
22,2,Butters,"What?? No!
"
22,2,Auxiliary,"You think we searched all over town and set up this trap to kill you? We're Catholics! We're here to give you what you deserve! A full transfer to the beautiful Maldive Islands. Luxury airfare and beach house included! 
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi,"A transfer?
"
22,2,Auxiliary,"The Church took care of everything, just like it always has from the beginning. ""Thank you for cleaning up all my cum.""
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi,"I can just... go? I can start over in the Maldives?
"
22,2,Auxiliary,"No one will make fun of you there. They can't even speak English. And don't worry, there'll be plenty of priests to take your place here. Look, I know it's a big change, but... you know what you have to do.
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi,"Yes, I do. I don't think I have any other choice.
"
22,2,Butters,"No. He can't.
"
22,2,Auxiliary,"Well, our work here is done! Praise be to Christ, guys. It certainly was a tough one, but I think we got everything cleaned up and-  Aaaaugh!
"
22,2,Assistant,"The Kumboni! Aaah!  Aaaaagh! Aah!
"
22,2,Priest,"Aaaaugh! Aaaaugh! 
"
22,2,Auxiliary," No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. 
"
22,2,Butters,"Father, you did it!
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi,"I'm so sorry, my child. I never meant to say we weren't pals.
"
22,2,Butters,"Does that mean you're gonna stay?
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi,"Of course. Now I have purpose, and I have meaning. My job here is to protect you. All of you.
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi,"The Lord be with you.
"
22,2,Congregants,"And with your spirit. 
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi,"Today I'd like to talk on the subject of penance. The penitent... have deep remorse, but for true penance, we must be humble enough to admit that the Lord's forgiveness is undeserved.
"
22,2,Randy,"Kind of like how getting raped by a Catholic priest is undeserved. 
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi,"In Job 42:6 we read ""Therefore, I reprehend myself and do penance in dust and ashes""
"
22,2,Townsman 1,"And in choir boys' butts and asses. 
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi,"So we are not to punish ourselves, but instead, we are to make ourselves passionate.
"
22,2,Townsman 5,"Like a Catholic priest at a Chuck E. Cheese. 
"
22,2,Randy,"Oh God, it's good to have my faith back!
"
22,2,Fr. Maxi,"Passionate to understand all that Christ sacrificed, and how hard it truly was.
"
22,2,Woman 4,"How hard what truly was? 
"
22,3,Mayor McDaniels,"People, it's time we faced some hard truths. The town is looking to us for answers, and all we keep doing is burying our heads. We need to cut the budget for this year's Christmas pageant.
"
22,3,Randy," My God...
"
22,3,Mayor McDaniels,"I've asked the director of the holiday show to stop by so we can all give him the news.
"
22,3,Ryan,"He's not going to take this well.
"
22,3,Councilwoman,"If he doesn't, we should just let him go. God knows it's about time.
"
22,3,Mayor's aide,"Hey, a lot of people like him, all right?
"
22,3,Mrs. Testaburger,"Yeah, and a lot of people think he stinks.
"
22,3,Mayor McDaniels,"Let's just get this over with.  All right, send him in. 
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey,"Hooooowwwdy ho! You wanted to see me? Better hurry. We only have two months before Christmas.
"
22,3,Mayor McDaniels,"Mr. Hankey, we called you in to let you know that... your Christmas Pageant funding has been cut. By half.
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey,"What? But I can barely make a good Christmas show with what I have!
"
22,3,Mayor McDaniels,"We just don't have the support for the Christmas show that we used to. The truth is... some people find you offensive.
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey,"Offensive? What about me is offensive?
"
22,3,Councilwoman,"Some people think shit isn't the best representation of Christmas.
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey,"Yuh... you people can't do this. Christmas is the most magical time of the year.
"
22,3,Mayor McDaniels,"The decision has already been made. Thank you, Mr. Hankey, and good luck with the show.
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey,"Okay, stop. Kids, the song's called ""Deck The Halls,"" not ""Let's All Suck Balls."" Mow, come on, kids.
"
22,3,Craig,"Why do we have to do this now?
"
22,3,Cartman,"Yeah, it's not even Halloween yet.
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey,"Restoration Hardware put up their Christmas decorations two weeks ago, all right? Now listen: I didn't want this either. I wanted the Denver Symphony, but they cut my budget and I'm stuck with you. Now let's take it from the top! 
"
22,3,PC Principal,"Vice Principal Strong Woman?
"
22,3,Strong Woman,"Yes, PC Principal?
"
22,3,PC Principal,"I was seeing if there's anything you... might want to discuss with me?
"
22,3,Strong Woman,"What would we need to discuss?!
"
22,3,PC Principal,"I am- so sorry- that I took advantage of my position and- manipulated you into a physical encounter.
"
22,3,Strong Woman,"Hey! I am a strong woman, all right?! I don't get manipulated! We both are guilty of an ill-advised relationship at the workplace, but that was long ago, and I have decided to move forward.
"
22,3,PC Principal,"Are you sure we can move forward?
"
22,3,Strong Woman,"Why not? We make a mistake, we move forward.
"
22,3,PC Principal,"I was just thinking there might still possibly be some fallout from-
"
22,3,Strong Woman,"Nope! We're just gonna forget about it and put it to rest.
"
22,3,PC Principal,"You don't think there's anything else to dis- to discuss?
"
22,3,Strong Woman,"No, I don't! Bye-bye. 
"
22,3,Stan,"Dude, Kyle! Dude!
"
22,3,Cartman,"Dude!
"
22,3,Kyle,"What?
"
22,3,Stan,"Did you read what Mr. Hankey tweeted last night?!
"
22,3,Kyle,"What Mr. Hankey... tweeted?
"
22,3,Stan,"Yeah. I guess after band rehearsals he went on Twitter to talk about us.
"
22,3,Cartman,"Look! 
"
22,3,Kyle,"Oh. Jesus Christ, dude.
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey,"
Santa Claus is on his way. He's loaded goodies on his sleigh.
He'll drop them off on Christmas Day


"
22,3,Kyle,"Mr. Hankey.
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey,"Oh, Kyle! Hoowwwwdy ho!
"
22,3,Kyle,"Mr. Hankey, everyone's really mad at you. Were you on Twitter last night?
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey," Yeah.
"
22,3,Kyle,"Did you tweet ""The kids of South Park are retarded homos who can't play music""?
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey," Yeah.
"
22,3,Kyle,"Why would you tweet that?! All the kids are really pissed off!
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey,"It was a bad attempt at a joke. I'm sorry. Will you tell the kids I didn't mean it?
"
22,3,Kyle,"What do you want me to say?
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey,"The fact is, I couldn't sleep last night so I took some Ambien. Do you take that stuff? It turns your brain into oatmeal. Please, Kyle, tell the kids I didn't mean any harm. We've gotta focus on Christmas! 
"
22,3,PC Principal,"All right, everyone, listen up. The vice principal has asked to speak with you today. She believes it is time that we all as a school finally discussed in-vitro fertilization.
"
22,3,Strong Woman,"That's right, kids. Many women today make the choice to have children without a man in their lives. They can have their eggs fertilized by an unknown person's sperm in a lab.
"
22,3,PC Principal,"That's right, Strong Woman. In today's society it is wrong to just assume that a pregnant woman had intercourse with a man.
"
22,3,Strong Woman," Ooohhhhhhh!
"
22,3,PC Principal,"St-students at this school need to be careful because it can be offensive to ask questions like ""Who's the father?""
"
22,3,Strong Woman," Oh! Ooohhhhhhh!
"
22,3,PC Principal," You- you all right, Strong Woman?
"
22,3,Strong Woman,"I'm fine!
"
22,3,PC Principal,"So-so we'd like to have all our students talk to their parents tonight about in-vitro fertilization, and after that, let's just put the whole issue behind us. 
"
22,3,Strong Woman,"That's my water breaking. Not a big deal. 
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey,"
Christmas time. It's Christmas time. Christmas time. Yeah, it's Christmas time

.
"
22,3,Mayor McDaniels," Hankey!  We need to talk about what you tweeted!
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey,"Oh, I'm sooo sorry. I took Ambien two nights ago and I called the schoolkids homos.
"
22,3,Mayor McDaniels,"No, I'm talking about what you tweeted last night!  ""The city council members are a bunch of pussy-licking Islamists.""
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey,"Oh-oh Jeez, did I say that? Listen, if you're tired and you can't sleep, DO NOT take Ambien. Okay? Whew!
"
22,3,Mayor McDaniels,"I'm afraid we have no option but to fire you as executive planning manager of the city council.
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey,"Fire me? Nonono, please. I-I'm really sorry.  No, no wait! Wait, please give me another chance! Don't do this! What about Christmas? 
"
22,3,PC Principal," It's okay. We'll be at the hospital soon. Just keep breathing.
"
22,3,Strong Woman," I didn't need your help!
"
22,3,PC Principal,"I'm just a co-worker helping another co-worker in need.
"
22,3,Strong Woman,"Yeah, well, people might get the wrong idea! I have worked my whole life to be the strongest woman possible, a person little girls could look up to. If those girls thought I was the type to get knocked up by my boss-
"
22,3,PC Principal,"I certainly do not want to put an pressures on you as a female, but at times I wonder if there is more we should discuss.
"
22,3,Strong Woman,"There's nothing to discuss! I made a mistake and I am MOVING FORWARD!
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey,"My civil rights are under attack. They can't just fire me from the Christmas show! The whole thing is my creation!
"
22,3,Male Lawyer,"Uh, last night you tweeted ""The city council can suck my Mexican dick.""
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey,"It was a joke. Look at me! I don't even have a dick! Get it?  Okay, okay, look, I know: it wasn't a good joke. But it really wasn't my fault. The fact is, I went home last night and I was angry. I couldn't sleep, so I took some Ambien. And then I started tweeting. Ambien messes with my head. You ever take that crap?
"
22,3,Female lawyer,"You want us to take this up against Ambien? They have the best lawyers in the world.
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey,"Well, I thought maybe I could get them in a defecation lawsuit.  Rrrgh!
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey,"And I never ever would have said those things about the city council, but the Ambien makes me kind of blackout.
"
22,3,Mr. Prewitt,"I'm sorry, sir, but we don't represent pieces of shit.
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey,"Why not?  Rrrgh!
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey,"And I just thought maybe we could convince the city council to hire me back.
"
22,3,Gerald,"Look, I'm sorry, but I learned a long time ago that if you defend poop, you get stained. 
"
22,3,Kyle,"Mr. Hankey?
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey,"Oh, Kyle.  Howwwdy ho.
"
22,3,Kyle,"What are you doing here?
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey,"Just tryin' to find some help. There isn't a lawyer in town who will take me. Wait a minute... You! You're the son of a lawyer. You have lawyer blood inside your veins! You can help me with my defecation lawsuit, Kyle!
"
22,3,Kyle,"Me? What can I do?
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey,"Please, Kyle. You're the only person left who can help me. You and me, pal, we are gonna fight the system!
"
22,3,Voice-over,"Paging Dr. Bender.
"
22,3,Dr. Bender,"Your vice principal gave birth to all five babies with no epidural. I must say, she's a very strong woman.
"
22,3,PC Principal,"That she is.
"
22,3,Dr. Bender,"The quintuplets are all healthy and resting away.  There are her babies, right there.
"
22,3,PC Principal,"Oh, dude. Bro.
"
22,3,Dr. Bender,"Yes, cute little buggers, aren't they? Three boys and two girls.
"
22,3,PC Principal,"I think it's wrong to force gender specification upon them at this young age.
"
22,3,Dr. Bender,"Funny. That's exactly what their mother said.  The quints are all Caucasian, blue-eyed, and something kind of weird.
"
22,3,PC Principal,"What's that?
"
22,3,Dr. Bender,"Well, the babies are all extremely PC, the likes of which I have never seen. Watch this.  Three black guys walk into a bar.  It's okay! It's okay! They left! They left! 
"
22,3,PC Principal,"Doctor, would it be possible for me to... hold the PC babies?
"
22,3,Dr. Bender,"Oh I'm sorry. That's only for the mother and father. Though, according tot he vice principal, the father doesn't even exist. 
"
22,3,Kyle," You guys! Hey guys! I think I figured it out.
"
22,3,Kenny,"(What?)
"
22,3,Kyle,"How to get Mr. Hankey another chance.  There's by-laws in the city council that community service leaders can't be terminated without a hearing. I need you guys there as character witnesses.
"
22,3,Stan,"Nnnope.
"
22,3,Cartman,"Not getting that stink on me.
"
22,3,Kyle,"He has a right to be heard. He's meant a lot to this town.
"
22,3,Stan,"Dude, why do you keep defending him, Kyle?
"
22,3,Cartman,"Yeah. You know everyone in town thinks he's a piece of shit.
"
22,3,Kyle,"Come on, guys. We can't just turn our backs. How many times has Mr. Hankey been there for us?
"
22,3,Stan,"Mmmm. Once, kind of?
"
22,3,Kyle,"Look, he messed up, but I don't know if he deserves everything that's coming down on him. I wanna stand by my friend.
"
22,3,Cartman,"Mm, let's see how that goes for you in 2018. 
"
22,3,PC Principal,"Vice Principal?
"
22,3,Strong Woman,"My babies! Where are they?
"
22,3,PC Principal,"Shh it's okay. The babies are fine, resting in the nursery. They're the most...  they're the most PC babies I've ever seen.
"
22,3,Strong Woman,"You shouldn't be here! People will start getting suspicious!
"
22,3,PC Principal,"Look I was the one who abused my position and took advantage of a subordinate-
"
22,3,Strong Woman,"Nobody took advantage of me!
"
22,3,PC Principal,"N-Not took advantage. You know what I'm saying.
"
22,3,Strong Woman,"And I'm a strong woman!
"
22,3,PC Principal,"All I want to do is help. We can say I'm the manny. And if anyone has a problem with that, then they have a problem with gender biases, and they can take it up with me! We can keep the truth about the babies totally hidden. 
"
22,3,Strong Woman,"Oh yes, that curriculum should be fine for the students. I'll start working on an all-school proposal.
"
22,3,PC Principal,"Oh yes, very good, Vice Principal. See that it is done by back to school night.
"
22,3,Female Nurse,"A-hall right, Mommy! Your little bundles of joy are here. Oh! And who's this?
"
22,3,PC Principal,"I am the manny. Anyone have a problem with that?
"
22,3,Female Nurse,"No, not at all.
"
22,3,Male Nurse,"Everything good here?  Aw! Are these PC babies? 
"
22,3,Voice-over,"And now, live from the town courthouse, it's the Hankey Hearing on South Park 13. 
"
22,3,Mr. Waithouse,"Mr. Hankey-  Fourteen hours ago did you or did you not say ""everyone in South Park is a God-damned douchebag""?
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey,"Y-es. That was a bad attempt at a Christmas joke.
"
22,3,Mr. Waithouse,"But there's nothing in that statement about Christmas.
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey,"That's what I said: it was a bad attempt.
"
22,3,Mr. Waithouse,"What part of the statement was actually-
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey,"You wanna hear a good Christmas joke?
"
22,3,Mr. Waithouse,"In 2005 you said-  You said that you had no recollection of a- 
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey,"Sorry, I got the sniffles.
"
22,3,Mr. Waithouse,"Mr Hankey, do you understand how important these statements are to the citizens of this town?
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey,"All I understand is it's only eight weeks until Christmas! If we don't stop wasting our time, we're all gonna miss out on the most magical part of the whole year!
"
22,3,Mr. Waithouse,"What did you mean last night when you tweeted, ""The Mayor of South Park is a titless whore""? 
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey,"Oh, come on! It was a joke! That's it! That's it, I've had enough of this whole fucking sham! Fuck all you and fuck this whole system! It's Christmastime!! 
"
22,3,Strong Woman,"It's okay. Shhh. We just need to get some diapers. Shhh.
"
22,3,Elderly Woman," Ohhh, what adorable little babies.
"
22,3,Strong Woman,"Thank you.
"
22,3,Elderly Woman," My, they look very PC.
"
22,3,Strong Woman,"Oh no, no, they're not very PC at all.
"
22,3,Man with Orange Shirt,"Awww, look at the PC babies!
"
22,3,Strong Woman,"They actually aren't PC.
"
22,3,Man with Orange Shirt,"No?  Did you hear Monica Lewinsky's becoming Republican? The Democrats left a bad taste in her mouth. 
"
22,3,Strong Woman,"Oh God, shhhh, nonononono. Sheee.
"
22,3,PC Principal," Is everything all right?
"
22,3,Man with Orange Shirt,"Oh Look! More PC babies!
"
22,3,Woman 1,"They're everywhere!
"
22,3,Strong Woman,"I told you we need to shop separately! Sh! Shhh!
"
22,3,Man 2," Excuse me, where's the Oriental food aisle? 
"
22,3,Man with Orange Shirt,"Shhh! Quiet! There's PC babies!
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey,"Gee whiz. Thanks for comin' out with me, Kyle.  These days, it's like you're my only friend.  So what's the plan, huh? What you got figured out to get my job back?
"
22,3,Kyle,"I had a plan. You decided to call the Mayor a titless whore!
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey," Oh, it was a joke, Kyle. Sometimes, when I take Ambien, I'm really groggy and moody the next day. It's a real side effect. It's printed right on the bottle.
"
22,3,Kyle," I don't know how much longer I can defend you. People are starting to think I'm shitty.
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey,"Kyle, don't you understand this whole thing is a smear campaign? Why are people focusing on a few stupid words I said when Christmas is just around the corner?! It's like everyone's forgot about what Christmas means!  Oh my God! Kyle, that's it! The holiday spirit!
"
22,3,Kyle,"It's October!
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey,"And that's the point! Don't you see? What we need to do is get everyone in the Christmas mood! We can bring the whole spirit of the holidays early!
"
22,3,Kyle," Okay, you do that.
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey,"Nonono. Kyle, you gotta help me! I can't do this alone!
"
22,3,Kyle,"I have homework and stuff!
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey,"You're all I have! Even my wife left with the Nuggets 'cause of all the pressure! Please!
"
22,3,Kyle,"Okay, fine! I'll help you. But listen to me: I don't care how restless you get tonight, NO AMBIEN!
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey,"Well, maybe just a little if I really can't sleep.
"
22,3,Kyle,"No! None! If you want my help this time, you aren't taking any Ambien tonight. That's the deal!
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey,"Yay! It's a deal! Oh boy, Kyle, I'm so excited! We're gonna bring the spirit of Christmas to South Park!
"
22,3,Jogger,"Oho, look at the little PC babies!
"
22,3,PC Principal,"Oh, no, we're from uh, Missouri.
"
22,3,Jogger,"I know a PC baby when I see one!  Who loves social justice? Who's the future? Who's the big bad future? Yes they are. 
"
22,3,Woman 2,"Ohh, PC babies!
"
22,3,PC Principal,"All right, please move along, folks. We don't want the babies to get excited. 
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey,"Helloooo South Park! Come on, everybody! Get over here!  Who wants to see a miracle?! Howwwdy ho, everyone! Guess what time it is? It's Christmastime! 
"
22,3,All,"Oohhhhh!
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey,"
Deck the halls and trim the trees, Christmas time is here.
Gonna sing and flush our worries away. It's the best time of the year


That's right, everybody! Who loves the holidays?  Just like when Christ was born, let's all be with our mothers and fathers and-  Let's not forget that, that boys and girls all over the world are

"
22,3,Man 3,"Hey! Hey, careful! You're upsetting the PC babies!
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey,"The PC what-Listen! Christmas season means peace on earth and good will towards men!  All right, all right look, what, what is the holiday season about? It's about loving each other, right? Loving and-  What?! What are they crying about now?!
"
22,3,Man 4,"Sometimes PC babies don't even know what they're crying about.
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey,"Well, then tell the babies to shut the fuck up!  Who the fuck brings a Goddamned baby to a Christmas show, anyway?!
"
22,3,Kyle," Mr. Hankey, stop!
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey,"Lemme go, Kyle! These people are idiots! 
"
22,3,Girl,"Mommy, something stinks. 
"
22,3,Mother,"Yeah, like shit. 
"
22,3,Man 5," You stand up for all pieces of crap?! Asshole!
"
22,3,Cartman,"Uh huh! 2018. 
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey,"Kyle, listen. It was 3 a.m. last night and I still hadn't slept, so I de-  Kyle? Kyle, please! They're gonna run me out of town, Kyle! They're going to erase me and everything I ever did.
"
22,3,Kyle," You want them to erase me, too?
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey,"Kyle, we can all be shitty sometimes.
"
22,3,Kyle,"Uh... 
"
22,3,PC Principal,"They're so strong, like their mother.
"
22,3,Strong Woman,"They're so PC, like... whoever their father is.  We'll never keep them quiet. Our only hope is to keep them hidden. 
"
22,3,PC Principal,"Can they ever know that I'm their dad?
"
22,3,Strong Woman,"We did the most un-PC thing imaginable. Think about what that would do to them. We can never let them know the debaucherous, sickening circumstances that brought them into this world.
"
22,3,PC Principal,"Then I'll just try to be the best principal to them that I possibly can.
"
22,3,Strong Woman,"And I'll be their strongest vice principal, and hopefully... the world will calm down and not do anything to upset them.
"
22,3,Newscaster,"Today... South Park says goodbye to Mr. Hankey. The longtime union of this town and the holiday figure... is over for good. We should all feel pretty great about ourselves, give ourselves a little, nice pat on the back, as we, as a society, continue to try and sweep away all the poop. 
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey,"Well, everyone, I guess this is goodbye. It sure has been swell.
"
22,3,Mayor McDaniels,"No goodbyes, Mr. Hankey. You just need to go. We already called you a Poober.
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey,"A Poober? They have that?  Oh, you mean Lyft. Well, okay. Goodbye, everyone. I hope I brought a few smiles and a few laughs into your hearts.
"
22,3,Mayor McDaniels," Goodbye, Mr. Hankey. 
"
22,3,Stan,"Where will he go?
"
22,3,Randy,"He'll have to find a place that accepts racist, awful beings like him. There are still places out there who don't care about bigotry and hate.
"
22,3,Mr. Hankey,"Hoowwwwdy ho!
"
22,3,Bart,"Cool man, talking crap.
"
22,3,Apu,"Welcome, my friend. Please, rest your weary feet and make yourself at home here.
"
22,3,All,"Hooray!
"
22,4,Mr. Mackey,"Allright, thanks for comin' in today to discuss your daughter's behavior, m'kay?
"
22,4,Randy,"Exactly what kind of trouble is Shelly in, Mr. Mackey?
"
22,4,Mr. Mackey,"Well, unfortunately, we found out our playground monitor has been accepting favors to look the other way at recess, and uh, your daughter sent him an inappropriate picture. Of her butthole. M'kay?
"
22,4,Randy,"Her butthole??  Shelly!  Why would the recess monitor want a picture of my daughter's butthole?!
"
22,4,Mr. Mackey,"We've been havin' a lot of issues at the school with kids vaping lately and, uh, they bribe the recess monitor however they can.
"
22,4,Randy,"Jesus Christ, how much worse can things get around here?!
"
22,4,Mr. Mackey,"Uhkay, let- uh, the, there is good news, m'kay? We had the picture analyzed and it turns out it was actually just a picture of a dog's butthole, m'kay , that your daughter claimed was hers. M'kay, there it is, a little fur right there. 
"
22,4,Randy,"Seriously?! Dog's butthole?! That's what we're doin' now, huh?! There's not enough bad things in the world, we get called into school, ""Here's a dog's butthole for ya."" That's what it's all come to, Shelly?!  I'm over it, Sharon.  I am seriously over it. Don't you just wanna start over? Go back to simpler times?
"
22,4,Sharon,"What do you mean?
"
22,4,Randy,"I've had it. School shootings, pieces of shit taking Ambien and tweeting, priests raping kids, and somehow... I'm not laughing anymore. Let's do it, Sharon. What I've always talked about. Let's get out of here. Go buy a farm and live off the land.
"
22,4,Sharon,"Are you being serious?
"
22,4,Randy,"Never been more serious.
"
22,4,Nelson," Hey, the light's green!
"
22,4,Randy," Shut up, Nelson!  Let's move out to the country. Go back to simple living when things mattered, like hard work and 'tegridy.
"
22,4,Sharon,"How will we make a living?
"
22,4,Randy,"By growing things and, and selling what we make with our hands. We can do this, Sharon. It's time.
"
22,4,Randy,"
 This ol' world is getting to me. There's just no trust, no 'tegridy.
So I loaded up the kids, took my wife by the arm,  and I moved on out to a Colorado farm.
Now it's early to bed, early to rise. The crops are plowed and it's no surprise
City folks are fightin' and I don't give a darn (darn, darn)
'Cause I make my livin' on a Colorado farm.
I gotta drive the tractor, gotta cut the grass
Chut-chut goes the baler like it's never gonna last
There's food in the kitchen and there's bud in the barn. (barn, barn)
That's life livin' on a Colorado farm.
Ice-cold beer, pickup truck. Country music, listin' shit.
We got tegridy to keep us warm.
That's what you get on a Colorado farm.
And I'm gonna stay on a Colorado farm.</i.>

 Shiiit.
"
22,4,Kyle," So just like that? Your parents sold your house and everything?
"
22,4,Stan,"Yeah, it takes me like an hour to get to school now. It sucks. All because Shelley bribed the playground monitor to let her vape during recess.
"
22,4,Kyle,"Why would your sister wanna get addicted to those things?
"
22,4,Cartman,"Well, your little brother does it too, Kyle.
"
22,4,Kyle,"What are you talking about?
"
22,4,Cartman,"You didn't know? The Kindergartners are like the biggest vapers at this school.
"
22,4,Boy," Vroom, vroom. I am a truck!
"
22,4,Jenny," Watch out for the monster.
"
22,4,Kyle,"Ike! Ike, do you have a vaping pen?!
"
22,4,Ike," Nope. 
"
22,4,Kyle,"Dude! Gimme that! 
"
22,4,Ike,"Hey, gimme back my vaporizer! 
"
22,4,Kyle,"What is this?  Cherry-flavored nicotine.  Are you joking?!
"
22,4,Ike,"Oh, come on! All the kids are doing it.
"
22,4,Jenny," Yeah, I like lemon flavor.
"
22,4,Boy," I like raspberry.
"
22,4,Kyle,"Why do you want nicotine?!
"
22,4,Jenny,"Do you know how hard it is being a kindergartner? We need a break sometimes.
"
22,4,Kyle,"These things are bad for you! Do you understand?! Bad kindergartners!
"
22,4,Quaid," Relax, bitch.  Try some gummy bear surprise. 
"
22,4,Stan," All right, where'd you guys get these?!
"
22,4,Randy,"Mornin' Joe? How's the farmin'?
"
22,4,Joe,"Doin' good, neighbor! Just planted some Purple Skunky Kush. Harvested the Super Hindu Haze last week.
"
22,4,Randy,"Well that's fine, Joe, just fine. I'm growin' some Green Willy Stranger myself. And the Catatonic Tegridy Bud is takin' well. 
"
22,4,Joe,"Well, see ya 'round, neighbor!
"
22,4,Randy,"So long, Joe! 
"
22,4,Stan,"Kindergartners said it's some big kid in a trench coat.  Hey look! 
"
22,4,Kyle,"That's gotta be him.
"
22,4,Stan,"What are you gonna do?
"
22,4,Kyle,"I'm gonna tell him if he sells a vape pen to my brother again, I'm gonna kick his ass!  HEY YOU! 
"
22,4,Butters,"Oh, hey fellas!
"
22,4,Stan," Butters?
"
22,4,Butters,"What are you guys doing?
"
22,4,Kyle,"Butters, are you selling vapes?
"
22,4,Butters,"Well, sure! Whatcha lookin' for?  I've got strawberry, vanilla, tropical passion...
"
22,4,Kyle,"WHAT?!
"
22,4,Butters,"Tropical passion. It's like mango and kiwi.
"
22,4,Stan,"Butters, do you understand this stuff is an epidemic in our school?!
"
22,4,Butters,"Yeah, and at five bucks a pop, we're gonna be rich!
"
22,4,Cartman," Butters, this is for Kyle. 
"
22,4,Butters,"Oof. 
"
22,4,Sharon,"Randy, I think we need to have a talk.
"
22,4,Randy," No time to talk, the agricultural inspector's about to drop by. Once we get certified from him, we can start sellin' like a real farm.  Have patience, wife. Soon our fortunes will change.  Oh, that must be him now! 
"
22,4,Towelie,"Yes, I'm with the State testin' board? Is this uh,...  Tegridy Farms?
"
22,4,Randy,"Name is right there on the sign. Come on back!
"
22,4,Towelie," So with this Vestin device, I can check not only the THC levels in your product but also detect any impurities and give you a final score based on overall chemical makeup.  Yep. That's good shit. Now let me test the levels in your organic house blend.  Yep. That's good shit. 
"
22,4,Randy,"Now, what about the Tegridy Jungle Bud?
"
22,4,Towelie,"Let's test it out.  Whoa.
"
22,4,Randy,"Yeah?
"
22,4,Towelie,"Whoa.
"
22,4,Randy,"Yeeahh?!
"
22,4,Towelie,"I don't know what Tegridy is, but... that is some good shit!
"
22,4,Randy," All right!
"
22,4,Cartman,"
Five, 
$5, 
$5 footlong.


"
22,4,Cartman," Butters!
"
22,4,Butters," Why'd you punch me, Eric?!
"
22,4,Cartman,"I had to!
"
22,4,Butters,"I thought we were partners!
"
22,4,Cartman,"Butters, next time when Kyle walks up to you and says ""Are you selling vape stuff,"" you say ""No, I am not, Kyle.""
"
22,4,Butters,"You punched me in the face!
"
22,4,Cartman,"Butters. we have to be extra-cautious right now, or else we're -- hang on, hang on --  Hang on. Hang on.  Ahhh!  Okay, we have to be extra-cautious, Butters. The whole operation is in a period of transition. 
"
22,4,Butters,"Well what's that supposed to mean?!
"
22,4,Cartman," In case you haven't noticed, we're falling behind. We haven't sold enough product to pay off our overhead. The people I bought from are on my ass! Everything costs money, Butters. The pens, the juice, even that jacket I got you.  We can't start getting sloppy now. Do you understand?
"
22,4,Butters,"Well, I don't know how this means you can go and punch me in the face-
"
22,4,Cartman,"Everything will make sense, Butters. I told you.  Just stick with the plan, okay?  Did you know that vaping is way healthier than smoking cigarettes? 
"
22,4,Randy," All right, everyone! Who's ready for some farm-to-table supper?!  We've got some hemp milk here, hemp oil and vinegar bruschetta, some hemp-seed tabouli. And guess what the napkins are made from?  Oh, wonder who that could be?  Howdy. What can I do ya for?
"
22,4,Vape Rep,"Is this Teh-gridy Farms?
"
22,4,Randy,"Yeah, name's right there on the sign.
"
22,4,Vape Rep,"Our company is interested in your product. We'd like to do some business with you.
"
22,4,Randy,"Really? Hey, that'd be great. What kind of company- 
"
22,4,Vape Rep,"We're one of the top vape companies in the state. We'd like to add your product to our line.
"
22,4,Randy," Oh no, sorry. I don't want my Tegridy Bud put in those pussy sticks.
"
22,4,Vape Rep,"Pussy sticks?
"
22,4,Randy,"Yeah, you know. Penis pens, wussy vape, lady joints. Not on my farm, no sirree.
"
22,4,Vape Rep,"You got a problem with vaping? It's cleaner and healthier than traditional smoking!
"
22,4,Randy,"That's nice. Now how's about you take that pussy stick and get off my farm before I shove it up your ass and you're blowin' mist out your butthole?
"
22,4,Vape Rep,"All right.  You can be a part of progress or you can get run over by it.
"
22,4,Randy," Yeah, whatever. All you're doin' is blowin' smoke -- Sorry, ""fruity steam."" Pussy.
"
22,4,Vape Rep,"What happened to your accent?
"
22,4,Randy,"Go vape some more, ya fuckin' puss!
"
22,4,Vape Rep," You'll be sorry! 
"
22,4,Kyle,"I need to speak with the principal.
"
22,4,Ms. Blaze,"Okay, what is it regarding?
"
22,4,Kyle,"I'd rather just talk to him.
"
22,4,Ms. Blaze,"Right through there. You're second in line. 
"
22,4,Cartman,"Oh, hey Kyle.
"
22,4,Butters,"Hi, Kyle!
"
22,4,Cartman,"What are you up to?
"
22,4,Kyle,"You know what I'm up to! 
"
22,4,Cartman," Okay, cool, but come check this out. This is really cool.
"
22,4,Kyle,"Don't touch me!
"
22,4,Cartman,"Just come- no, just come see. 
"
22,4,Kyle,"Don't- touch me!
"
22,4,Cartman,"This is really cool.  You know, Kyle, people all need a way to relax. And there's no proof that vaping is that bad for you.
"
22,4,Kyle,"You're selling it to kindergartners!
"
22,4,Cartman,"Kindergartners need a break too, Kyle!
"
22,4,Butters,"You know they took away their nap time.
"
22,4,Kyle,"You're such penises!
"
22,4,Cartman,"Would you rather the kindergartners smoke cigarettes?  Would you rather they drank? That's not good!  Kyle, Kyle, Kyle! Okay, okay!  Just please listen, all right? The truth is... we want out. Butters and I thought we could just make some easy money, but you gotta pay off the 6th graders, then you gotta pay off the recess monitor to look the other way. We're in deep, Kyle. Just let us see enough to get out of debt, and we will stop. I swear it.
"
22,4,Kyle,"You're so full of shit.
"
22,4,Cartman,"Come on, Kyle, we all make mistakes. Did you already forget last week? You know... Ronan Farrow was here asking about you.
"
22,4,Kyle,"Ronan Farrow? No he wasn't.
"
22,4,Cartman,"Yes, Kyle! He was right over there! Just please,  give us two days to make back the money we need to get out from under this. and we will stop. You have my word.
"
22,4,Kyle,"Fine. But no more pushing it on little kids! You got that?!
"
22,4,Cartman,"Okay, I'll focus my marketing on another direction. Thank you, Kyle. 
"
22,4,Randy,"Whatcha doin', Joe?
"
22,4,Joe,"Oh, hey Randy. We uh, we sold the farm.
"
22,4,Randy,"Just like that, huh? You gonna let those people with pussy sticks take over everythin'?!
"
22,4,Joe,"Yeah. They paid us great. My wife and I are gonna move to Maui!
"
22,4,Randy,"Oh. I hope you didn't pack your tegridy, 'cause clearly, your tegridy ain't goin'.  Are you still here?!
"
22,4,Towelie," Ah I-I didn't know chickens wore suspenders.
"
22,4,Randy,"Agh! 
"
22,4,Cartman," Man, am I feeling tired! All this hard work at school?
"
22,4,Butters,"Yeah, I wish I had a little pick-me-up! Somethin' fresh and fruity to go with my lunch!
"
22,4,Kyle,"Just stop. It's so obvious what you guys are doing.
"
22,4,Cartman," It sounds so great right now!  Can anyone help with some fun, fruity flavors? 
"
22,4,Vaping Man,"Oh yeah!
"
22,4,Cartman," Hey guys! It's the Vaping Man! What are you doing here, Vaping Man?
"
22,4,Vaping Man,"I'm here to offer my fun, fruity flavors in a refreshing mist.
"
22,4,Cartman,"Vaping? Hey, that's bad for you. Vaping's only for cool kids.
"
22,4,Kyle," Can I talk to you for a second?
"
22,4,Cartman,"Sure, Kyle. What is this about?
"
22,4,Kyle,"Can I talk to you over here?
"
22,4,Cartman,"Well of course. 
"
22,4,Kyle," What did I say about pushing it on little kids?!
"
22,4,Cartman,"How is this pushing it on little kids, Kyle?
"
22,4,Kyle,"Fun, fruity Vaping Man?!
"
22,4,Cartman,"It's marketing! Kyle, we have to make the money to pay off our dealer. How else are we supposed to do it?
"
22,4,Kyle,"All right, how much do you owe the dealer?
"
22,4,Cartman,"Why?
"
22,4,Kyle,"How much?!
"
22,4,Randy,"Isn't this great, Stan? Livin' off the land? 
"
22,4,Stan,"No, it sucks. I hate this. I wanna go back home.
"
22,4,Randy,"Well you see that? We're talkin' now.  When was the last time we really talked like this?
"
22,4,Stan,"I hate you so much.
"
22,4,Randy,"Ithink we're havin' a breakthrough moment. I want to give you somethin', son. Somethin' I made that I want you to have.  It's a hemp hat.
"
22,4,Stan,"No.
"
22,4,Randy,"Come on, let's just see how it fits.
"
22,4,Stan,"Pleaes, no.
"
22,4,Randy,"Here, just-just look. Just try it. 
"
22,4,Spin Doctors,"
One, two
princes kneel before you
That's -- 


"
22,4,Spin Doctors,"
One, two
princes kneel before you 


"
22,4,Randy,"Whoa.
"
22,4,Spin Doctors,"
That's what I said now.
Princes -- 


"
22,4,Clerk,"There you go, and thanks for shoppin' at Big Vape. 
"
22,4,Cartman," That's him. That's my guy.
"
22,4,Vape Dealer,"There you are. You got my money?
"
22,4,Cartman," Kyle? 
"
22,4,Kyle,"Look, my friend is very stupid and should have never gone into business with you. 
"
22,4,Vape Dealer,"Who are you? 
"
22,4,Kyle,"I'm just seeing if I can help settle things. You probably don't realize it, but vaping is a really big problem at our school.
"
22,4,Vape Dealer,"Look, I'm just filling a job that somebody else would fill, all right? 
"
22,4,Kyle,"Okay, look, this is the money I've saved up from my past three birthdays. Can we call this even and end it?
"
22,4,Vape Dealer,"Aw, come on, man. I don't wanna take your birthday money. 
"
22,4,Cartman,"Whoa, hey dude! Why is there a dead hooker next to you?
"
22,4,Kyle,"What?
"
22,4,Vape Dealer,"What?
"
22,4,Cartman,"Dude, that is a dead hooker. What are you doing with it?! I'm calling the cops! 
"
22,4,Vape Dealer,"You just put that dead hooker there.
"
22,4,Kyle,"Cartman, what are you doing??
"
22,4,Cartman," There's a dead hooker at the vape store!
"
22,4,Butters," There! 
"
22,4,Vape Dealer," Ow!
"
22,4,Kyle,"Oh shit!
"
22,4,Cartman,"Get the vaporizers, and the cash! Get the cash, Kyle!
"
22,4,Kyle,"Wha-what? What are you doing??
"
22,4,Cartman,"Just get the- Oh shit! Ronan Farrow!
"
22,4,Kyle,"WHAT?!
"
22,4,Cartman,"Get the stuff and the cash! Ronan Farrow, Kyle! We've gotta get out of here! 
"
22,4,Randy,"Bless us, Lord, and our little cannabis farm, and may we always keep our tegridy. Amen.  So, how was everyone's day?
"
22,4,Sharon,"Uh, well, not great. Uh, Stan got caught with a vaping pen.
"
22,4,Randy," With a WHAT?!
"
22,4,Sharon,"You know, those little pen and cartridge things with the mist?
"
22,4,Randy,"Stan had a vape pen?!  You had a fucking vaping-?! Get up to your room right now!  Way to underreact, Sharon! 
"
22,4,Randy," Where did you get this?!
"
22,4,Stan,"It's not mine. I took it from a kindergartner.
"
22,4,Randy,"Yeah, right! My own son using a pussy stick!  Don't you know what these things are doin' to our way of life?! I've had enough!
"
22,4,Stan,"What are you gonna do?
"
22,4,Randy,"You think I'm just gonna stand around while they destroy my family?! We've worked this farm and this land for over four days! I'm not about to let some vape queens take it all away from us! 
"
22,4,Mr. Mackey," Oh, hello, Kyle.
"
22,4,Kyle,"Mr. Mackey, I need to talk to you about some things going on at school.
"
22,4,Mr. Mackey,"M'okay, like what?
"
22,4,Cartman," Oh, hi Kyle.
"
22,4,Butters," Hey Kyle! 
"
22,4,Cartman,"We were just talking to the counselor about some college opportunities. What are you doing here?
"
22,4,Kyle,"You know what I'm doing here!
"
22,4,Cartman,"Okay, well, we really should talk first, Kyle.
"
22,4,Kyle,"NO. Mr. Mackey, there's a big operation going on at the school
"
22,4,Cartman,"Kyle, things have changed. You need to listen.
"
22,4,Kyle,"Things are getting out of control-
"
22,4,Cartman,"Kyle, listen! You want to hear this!
"
22,4,Kyle,"-and you need to know what's going on!
"
22,4,Cartman,"You need to hear this!
"
22,4,Kyle,"What?!
"
22,4,Cartman,"We'lll be right back, Mr. Mackey. 
"
22,4,Mr. Mackey,"Huh okay. 
"
22,4,Kyle,"Let go of me! 
"
22,4,Cartman,"Kyle, listen. It's bad.
"
22,4,Kyle,"What's bad?!
"
22,4,Cartman,"The guy we tried to frame at the vape shop. He was the one the sixth graders got their shit from. The sixth graders are pissed at us, Kyle! We have to break into the vape shop and steal enough stuff to make the sixth graders happy.
"
22,4,Kyle,"You guys decided to beat up the dealer!
"
22,4,Cartman,"Yeah, but the sixth graders know you were there!
"
22,4,Kyle,"How?!
"
22,4,Butters,"'Cause Eric told them!
"
22,4,Kyle,"We are all in this together, Kyle! We gotta rob the vape shop, and then we can put this all behind us.
"
22,4,Butters,"Please, Kyle! We still gotta pay people off!
"
22,4,Vaping Man," Oh yeah! Hey bitches! Where's my motherfuckin' money?!
"
22,4,Butters,"Run!
"
22,4,Cartman,"Aah!
"
22,4,Kyle,"Aah!
"
22,4,Robert Tepper,"
 We're not indestructible
Baby, better get that straight.
I think that its unbelievable
How you give in to the hands of fate -- 


"
22,4,Spin Doctors,"
One, two
princes kneel before you
That's what I said now 


"
22,4,Sharon,"Randy, where are you going?
"
22,4,Randy," Gonna go fight for my children's future. 
"
22,4,Randy,"All right, you bunch of vape-smoking' pussies! You try and take my way of life?! Time to show you some tegridy! 
"
22,4,Patron,"Tegridy? What's tegridy? 
"
22,4,Spin Doctors/Robert Tepper,"
That's what I said now 
One, two --
There's no easy way out
That's what I said now
One, two --
There's no shortcut home
That's what I said now
One, two --
There's no easy way out
That's what I said now
One, two --
Givin' in can't be wrong
That's what I said now 
One, two --
There's no easy way out


"
22,4,Randy," Get your stupid mist out of my fucking face!
"
22,4,Bodybuilder,"Hey! I like to vape. You think I'm a pussy?
"
22,4,Randy,"Yup! 
"
22,4,Bodybuilder,"Ow! 
"
22,4,Butters,"Wow! You're so smart to think of a siphon, Kyle!
"
22,4,Kyle,"Just shut up and keep pumping!
"
22,4,Vape Rep,"What are you kids doing?
"
22,4,Kyle,"Awww, shit!
"
22,4,Vape Rep,"You little hoodlums break in through the window?! I oughtta break your little legs!
"
22,4,Randy," I don't think so!
"
22,4,Kyle,"Mr. Marsh!
"
22,4,Randy,"Just what the Sam Hell you boys doin' here?!
"
22,4,Kyle,"All right, listen. I should have talked to an adult from the beginning.
"
22,4,Cartman,"Kyle, what are you doing?
"
22,4,Kyle,"There are these three vaping syndicates at our school-
"
22,4,Cartman,"Kyle?
"
22,4,Kyle,"-and these guys are one of them.
"
22,4,Cartman,"Nononononono.
"
22,4,Kyle,"They had someone buying stuff from here for them, and then they sold it to kids.
"
22,4,Cartman,"Okay, Kyle, I'm calling Ronan Farrow. 
"
22,4,Kyle,"The sixth graders, these guys, and Becky Thompson are all at each other for control of the playground.
"
22,4,Cartman,"Hello, Ronan? Eric Cartman. Yeah, hey.
"
22,4,Kyle,"I was going to tell an adult, but these guys said they'd stop.
"
22,4,Cartman,"So you know Kyle? Yeah, well, you're right about him.
"
22,4,Randy,"It's good you came clean, son. It shows that you've got- 
"
22,4,Vape Rep,"Didn't your mommy teach you it doesn't pay to mess with progress?!
"
22,4,Randy,"Yeah. She taught me somethin' else too! If you're gonna fight for your tegridy, don't forget to bring a towel.
"
22,4,Towelie,"Vape on this, bitch! 
"
22,4,Randy,"Yeah!  Take that, stupid vaping!  Move it boys! Come on, go go go! 
"
22,4,Butters,"Does this mean we're out of the vaping business, fellas?
"
22,4,Randy,"
It's in you. 
It's in me. 
A little somethin' called tegridy.


"
22,4,Randy," Well, shit. Looks like we made it to another sunrise.
"
22,4,Stan,"Oh God, this is just gonna get worse, isn't it?
"
22,4,Randy,"Yup son. I think the fight's just startin'. Farmers like us are under attack.
"
22,4,Towelie,"Yupper. We got a lot of work to do. We can't let 'em take what makes us special.
"
22,4,Voice-over,"Tegridy Weed, from Tegridy Farms. Made... with a little Colorado tegridy. Comin' soon to a dispensary near you.
"
22,5,Adult Kenny,"October was always my favorite month.  It was always that misty season when everyone embraced the weird and scary.  Our little town was no different.  I was just a kid back then.  Me and all the other children were preparing for the greatest night of the year.  But this Halloween was different, and it would change us all... forever.
"
22,5,Mr. Mackey,"Whoa!  What the?  Alright, who left their scooter here?! M'kay?! Whose damn scooter is this?!
"
22,5,Neighbor," It isn't anybody's. They're e-scooters. Anyone can use them.
"
22,5,Mr. Mackey,"E-scooters?
"
22,5,Neighbor,"Yeah, see? There's a bunch here and a bunch more down there.  Everyone can use them to get around town, you know? Leave them where they want for the next person.
"
22,5,Mr. Mackey,"Well, where the hell do they all come from?!
"
22,5,Neighbor," Nobody knows. 
"
22,5,Stan,"So anyone can use them?
"
22,5,Cartman,"Yeah, I think they just work with your cell phone.
"
22,5,Kyle,"How?
"
22,5,Stan,"Oh yeah, it has one of them little scan thingies. Let me see.  Yeah, dude, it's downloading the app.
"
22,5,Cartman,"Kewl!
"
22,5,Stan,"Aww, it wants a credit card number.
"
22,5,Cartman,"Do you wanna use your mom's or my mom's?
"
22,5,Stan,"Let's do your mom's
"
22,5,Cartman,"3715 ... 523 ...
"
22,5,Stan,"Is that an AmEx?
"
22,5,Cartman,"Yeah, you want a visa? 8292 438 7766507
"
22,5,Stan,"Espiration?
"
22,5,Cartman,"45261
"
22,5,Stan,"Security code?
"
22,5,Cartman," 921 
"
22,5,Kyle,"Dude, it worked! 
"
22,5,Cartman,"How is it, dude?
"
22,5,Stan,"Pretty stupid but sweet.
"
22,5,Kyle," Oh my God. Dude. Oh my God.
"
22,5,Cartman,"What?
"
22,5,Kyle,"We should use these things to trick or treat on Halloween!
"
22,5,Cartman,"Hey yeah! We could cover so much more ground!
"
22,5,Stan," We'd get, like, more candy than anybody.
"
22,5,Kyle,"Everybody get the app! This is gonna be the best Halloween ever! 
"
22,5,Kenny,"(Oh, wait, you guys. See, I don't have a phone.)
"
22,5,Cartman,"Oh yeah, Kenny doesn't have a phone 'cause he's poor.
"
22,5,Kyle,"Oh. Well, that's okay. We'll figure it out. We always do!
"
22,5,All," All right!
"
22,5,Mr. Mackey," What the... what the... fuck is going on? 
"
22,5,Lolly,"How can I help you?
"
22,5,Mr. Mackey,"Well, I'm just getting my Halloween candy. Want to make sure I get enough. Last year I ran out and the kids egged my house, m'kay?
"
22,5,Lolly,"Yeah, you don't wanna run out of candy on Halloween.
"
22,5,Mr. Mackey,"I'll take three large bags each of Snickers Fun Size, Payday Bite Size, Almand Joy Snack Size, and Reese's Teenie Weenie Size, m'kay?
"
22,5,Lolly,"Sounds like you wanna be prepared. 
"
22,5,Mr. Mackey,"Hey, c-can, can I ask you something? Wha, what's up with all these damn scooters?
"
22,5,Lolly,"Oh, I think you get an app on your phone and you can use them all over town.
"
22,5,Mr. Mackey,"No, but, like, where did they come from? You know, it's like one day everything was fine, and the next there were these fucking scooters everywhere. 
"
22,5,Lolly,"You don't like scooters? 
"
22,5,Mr. Mackey,"I just think people should drive, m'kay? I don't think people should ""scoot."" I just... I just hope the future isn't ""scooting.""
"
22,5,Lolly,"Well, they seem pretty convenient.  What can be so wrong about that? Happy Halloween. 
"
22,5,Kenny,"(Woo-hoo!)  (Hey, dude! Check it out! I got my pail!)
"
22,5,Cartman,"Great, cool. You got your pail.
"
22,5,Kenny,"(Yup!)
"
22,5,Cartman,"Come on in, Kenny. Let's talk.  Go ahead. Take a seat, Ken.  Okay Kenny, here's the deal. Um, you know that we have this awesome plan to trick-or-treat on e-scooters this year. YOU... don't have a phone.
"
22,5,Kyle,"Kenny, we've been talking and, the truth is, without a scooter, you're just gonna slow us down.
"
22,5,Cartman,"It's probably best you trick or treat with someone else this year.
"
22,5,Kenny,"(But we always trick or treat together)
"
22,5,Stan,"Yeah, but that's just it, Kenny. To use a scooter, you have to have a phone and... I mean, if we're waiting for you, we're gonna be as slow as all the other kids. It's... like, you know?
"
22,5,Kenny,"(Guys, please.)
"
22,5,Cartman,"Look, Kenny, I always told you that one day, being poor was gonna catch up with you. Okay? But you didn't wanna listen. You just kept on being poor, and now it's Halloween and you don't have a cell phone.
"
22,5,Kyle,"Okay, okay. Cartman, that's not the point.
"
22,5,Cartman,"He needs to hear this, Kyle. You know, people are just poor, and they think it's not gonna come back to bite them in the ass.
"
22,5,Kyle,"That's enough, dude!
"
22,5,Stan,"We're sorry, Kenny. It's just... This awesome plan to get shitloads of candy doesn't... work with... you. 
"
22,5,Cartman,"Shouldn't have been poor, Kenny.
"
22,5,Mr. Mackey,"

22,5,Mr. Mackey,"Whoa, fuck me!
"
22,5,Clyde,"As soon as the school bell rings, we find the nearest scooters and begin trick or treating in Butters' neighborhood here. Then at 3:00 P.M. we- 
"
22,5,Jimmy,"Sh sh-sh-sh-sh Shi sh-shi shit.
"
22,5,Clyde,"Cover it! Cover it!  Oh. Hey, Kenny.
"
22,5,Kenny,"(Hey, dude. Uh, look. I was wondering, do you think I could trick or treat with you guys this year?)
"
22,5,Clyde,"You wanna trick or treat with us? What about Stan and Kyle and those guys?
"
22,5,Kenny,"(Oh, you know, I just thought I'd switch it up this year, hehe)
"
22,5,Clyde,"Yeah, look, don't tell anybody, but, um... we're gonna trick or treat on e-scooters this year. We're seriously gonna rake in the candy. Problem is, e-scooters work with a phone and pretty sure  you don't h-have one
"
22,5,Kenny,"(Oh, I won't slow you guys down. I swear!)
"
22,5,Clyde,"Dude, it's trick or treat. It's not something we're just willing to mess around with, okay? 
"
22,5,Mr. Mackey,"What the hell?  Aaaah! 
"
22,5,Rider 7,"Agh!  Sorry, dude.
"
22,5,Mr. Mackey,"Goddamnit, where'd you get that?!
"
22,5,Rider 7,"Oh, they're all over, dude. Super-convenient. Try it out. 
"
22,5,Kenny,"(Hey, guys!)  (So listen, I was thinking, maybe I'd trick or treat with you guys this year!)
"
22,5,Wendy,"You wanna trick or treat with us? Why?
"
22,5,Kenny,"(Oh, you know! Just trying to be gender-neutral, hahahaha!)
"
22,5,Cartman,"So, uh, you guys think you're gonna get a lot of candy trick or treating this year?
"
22,5,Butters,"We're gonna get a butt-load of candy!
"
22,5,Tolkien,"Shh! Butters, don't tell them our secret!
"
22,5,Cartman,"Oh, we have a little secret too!
"
22,5,Stan,"But we're not gonna tell people 'cause they're gonna copy us. So let's just leave it at that.
"
22,5,Clyde,"Fine by us. So what are you gonna be for Halloween?
"
22,5,Cartman,"Be? I'm gonna be on an e-scooter taking all your candy!  That's what I'm gonna be!
"
22,5,Kyle,"Dude!
"
22,5,Cartman,"Sorry!
"
22,5,Jimmy,"Hey, wait! That's what we're doing!
"
22,5,Stan,"What?
"
22,5,Craig,"Hold on! You guys are using e-scooters on Halloween too?
"
22,5,Wendy,"Oh, you jerks found out the girls are all trick or treating on e-scooters, and you stole our idea!
"
22,5,Cartman,"Okay. Hold on! This is bullcrap! 
"
22,5,Adult Kenny,"It was the day before Halloween. All of our parents were gathered together to try and stop a nightmare from coming true.
"
22,5,Sgt. Yates," All right, everyone. Quiet, please. We have a community crisis on our hands, and it's my job to keep you informed. As you know, there's been a rise in the use of e-scooters in our town. Officer Brown is head of crisis control. Officer?
"
22,5,Officer Brown,"We have inside information that kids everywhere are going to be using e-scooters for tricks or treats. Now, with these things, kids and teens can cover a lot of ground in very little time. They can hit more houses than ever before. Because of the scooters, we also expect that people from all the neighboring counties will commute for tricks or treats in our town. Because of all of this, we believe each household needs to be prepared... with at least $6,000 worth of candy.
"
22,5,Jimbo,"$6,000?
"
22,5,Stephen,"Well that's ridiculous! We, we can't all buy that much candy! Let's just get rid of those scooters!
"
22,5,Townsfolk,"Yeah! That's right! Let's do it!
"
22,5,Mr. Mackey," You can't get rid of them! I tried! You all just sat there while those things piled up on our sidewalks! You all rode 'em around, m'kay?! I saw you! You could have used your cars, but you just had to scoot!  And now tricks or treats is here! Well I'll tell you one thing! I'm not gonna let my house get egged this year for not having enough candy! So what are we gonna do?!
"
22,5,Townsman,"We gotta get more candy! 
"
22,5,Mr. Mackey,"Get-whoa-get out of the way! 
"
22,5,Lolly,"Look, I got nothing left, all right?
"
22,5,Mr. Mackey,"What did you-? Get me some of those Hi-Chews.
"
22,5,Lolly,"Those are already accounted for by folks who called in!
"
22,5,Mr. Mackey,"Well, then, let me, let me have the Whatchamacallits?
"
22,5,Lolly,"Those are for me! I've gotta protect my own house!
"
22,5,Mr. Mackey,"Look, you've gotta give me some more fucking candy! 
"
22,5,Lolly,"There's nothing left here. You've gotta go somewhere else! 
"
22,5,Mr. Mackey,"Where, where's the candy, m'kay? Candy?  Uhh, what aisle is the candy in?
"
22,5,Associate,"Uh, aisle 7.
"
22,5,Mr. Mackey," Uh 7, aisle 7! 
"
22,5,Mr. Mackey," 20 Reese's Pieces, one Twix, 16 Raisinets.  Just... just a minute! 12 Hat Tamles, half a Nestle Crun-  Okay, come in!  What do you want?
"
22,5,Kenny,"(I, I just... It's Halloween and I should be happy, but I'm not happy at all.)
"
22,5,Mr. Mackey,"Wait. Are you here for counseling?
"
22,5,Kenny,"(Yeah! What should I do? I'm gonna miss trick-or-treating. It sucks.)
"
22,5,Mr. Mackey,"Do you realize it's about to be World War III out there?! We have bigger problems! Consider yourself lucky, m'kay?! Everyone's gonna be scooting and there's no way to stop it. Why are you the one kid who doesn't want to use them?
"
22,5,Kenny,"(I can't use one. I don't have a phone.)
"
22,5,Mr. Mackey,"What do you mean? You can't use those things without a phone?
"
22,5,Kenny,"(No. It sucks. Halloween was a night without phones, man.)
"
22,5,Mr. Mackey,"But, Kenny, if that's true, then... could there be a way to cut the connection?
"
22,5,Kenny,"(I don't know. I guess if you-)  (Wait a minute. Take down the cell phone tower. Then nobody has a phone on Halloween!)
"
22,5,Mr. Mackey,"Jesus! You really think that could work?!
"
22,5,Kenny,"(Yeah! I just have to ride 30 minutes outside of town! Oh, wait. I can't. I don't have a scooter.)
"
22,5,Mr. Mackey," No. You don't need a scooter, 'cause I got a fucking car. 
"
22,5,Randy,"Yehello?
"
22,5,Stephen,"Heh hey Randy. Linda and I, we... we were talking about how we never see you guys anymore, and we were thinking we'd hang out with you for Halloween, heh.
"
22,5,Randy,"Oh, I see. You want a place to hide on Halloween night, and you thought out here on the farm you'd be safe.
"
22,5,Stephen,"Well, that, and we really wanna hang with you guys.
"
22,5,Linda," Yes.
"
22,5,Randy,"You think them fancy e-scooters don't make it out here? We're gonna be bombarded just like you city folk.
"
22,5,Stephen,"Then please, Randy, can we just borrow a little candy?
"
22,5,Randy,"I gotta keep what I have.
"
22,5,Stephen,"Please, Randy, the stores are all out! Just a few Milky Ways to get us through the first couple hours, please! We can cut 'em up. We can- we can hand them out little pieces at a time.
"
22,5,Randy," I gotta protect my own, Stotch! I'm sorry. 
"
22,5,Linda," What are we gonna do??
"
22,5,Stephen,"It's okay, Linda! It's okay! On Halloween night, I'll... I'll just one of those e-scooters myself. I'll go around and, and I'll trick-or-treat. I'll... I'll get a bunch of-
"
22,5,Linda," No, you can't leave me alone!
"
22,5,Stephen," I'll get a bunch of candy, Linda, and I'll bring it back to our house for us to hand out! It's going to be okay.
"
22,5,Gerald,"Aah! Aaaah! Here! Here, take it! Just take it!
"
22,5,Richard," OH GOD!!! WE NEED MORE THREE MUSKETEERS! WE CAN'T BE OUT! THERE HAS TO BE MORE!!
"
22,5,Kyle," Jesus Christ! Where'd all these other people come from?!
"
22,5,Cartman,"We have to get more candy than anyone else, even if we die!
"
22,5,Mr. Mackey,"The tower should be just over that ridge.
"
22,5,Kenny,"(Let's just hope to hell this works.)
"
22,5,Rider 8," Oof, Sorry.
"
22,5,Mr. Mackey,"What gives them the right, huh? I mean, some big company came and dumped a bunch of scooters everywhere without asking anyone if it was okay.
"
22,5,Kenny,"(Yeah, people don't even care if shit's dumped everywhere. Everyone just loves technology)
"
22,5,Mr. Mackey,"Yeah, you're right. You're a good kid, Kenny. I always thought so. I know we kind of all forget about you sometimes, but you're smart, compassionate, and you might even make a good counselor someday. 
"
22,5,Rider 9,"Sorry, dude.
"
22,5,Jimbo,"Keep going, Ned! Don't you give up on me! 
"
22,5,Stephen," Move it! Get out of my way!  Trick or treat!
"
22,5,Jimbo,"The hell are you doing, Stotch?
"
22,5,Stephen,"Happy Halloween! Trick or Treat!
"
22,5,Jimbo,"You're just trying to get our candy for your house!
"
22,5,Stephen,"That's not true!
"
22,5,Jimbo,"You don't even have a costume!
"
22,5,Stephen,"Yes I do! I'm Megyn Kelly! Now trick or treat!
"
22,5,Kyle,"That's it! I can't go anymore!
"
22,5,Cartman,"Keep moving, Kyle!
"
22,5,Stan,"Dude, we can't carry any more candy!
"
22,5,Cartman,"All right, over here. Come on!
"
22,5,Kyle,"What are we doing?
"
22,5,Cartman,"We've gotta make room for more candy. Come on. Eat as much as you can. 
"
22,5,Kyle,"I don't... I don't know how I can keep doing this.
"
22,5,Cartman,"Yes, you can, Kyle.
"
22,5,Stan,"I can't any more. 
"
22,5,Kenny,"(Find a way inside. I'll climb the tower.)
"
22,5,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, sounds good! 
"
22,5,Kenny,"(Oh, fuck!) 
"
22,5,Mr. Mackey,"Jesus Christ! 
"
22,5,Guard,"I'm all out of candy, all right?! Go look somewhere else!
"
22,5,Mr. Mackey,"We're not here for tricks or treats!
"
22,5,Guard,"Yeah, sure! That's what the last people said! Then they dumped my entire bowl in a pillowcase!
"
22,5,Kenny,"(Dude, relax. It's okay.)
"
22,5,Guard,"I'm just a security guard, all right?!  We never even used to have trick-or-treaters out this far!
"
22,5,Mr. Mackey,"That's why he has to take down this cellphone tower: To stop the scooters! Jason, I'm a counselor. You need to trust me. 
"
22,5,Yates,"There's a bowl of Rice Krispie treats at the side door! The side door, you animals!
"
22,5,Officer,"Detective, look!
"
22,5,Reporter,"We are 2 hours ahead here! New York has completely run out of candy! 
"
22,5,Jimmy,"Butters? We've lost Butters!
"
22,5,Tolkien,"Oh God, Butters! 
"
22,5,Sharon,"We're never going to have enough candy.
"
22,5,Kenny,"(Okay, that's got it!)
"
22,5,Mr. Mackey,"All right, Kenny!  Let's see you do THIS with a goddamned scooter! 
"
22,5,Adult Kenny,"And just like that, it was over. Nobody knew what happened. They only knew their phones didn't work.
"
22,5,Clyde,"Does anyone have a signal?
"
22,5,Adult Kenny,"No scooters, no texting, not even GPS. It was like the old Halloween. 
"
22,5,Rider 10,"And I can't get an Uber home!
"
22,5,Adult Kenny,"Mr. Mackey was able to get back to the town and offer counseling to everyone who needed it.  And as for me? I was able to spend the rest of the night with my friends, because we were all equal again.
"
22,5,The boys," Trick or treat.
"
22,5,Kenny," (Trick or treat!)
"
22,5,Adult Kenny,"It was the last Halloween that still felt like Halloween. It was the last time... it was good. 
"
22,6,Jimbo,"Yeah-heah! You got it, Ned! That was a nice shot!
"
22,6,Ned,"Mn-thanks. I thought so too.
"
22,6,Jimbo,"Come on, let's see what we got.  Huh. Looks like you shot the shit out of it. There's nothin' left.  Hey. Lookie here. Jesus. You ever seen animal tracks that big? 
"
22,6,Ned,"Mmm-no I have not, Jimbo.
"
22,6,Jimbo,"Looks like a bear. A huge one! Come on, the tracks go this way.  Look at that. Looks like bear droppings. But with a man poop right next to it.
"
22,6,Ned,"I'm scared. 
"
22,6,Jimbo,"What the hell are we dealing with, Ned? Whatever it is, it was heard recently. 
"
22,6,Randy,"Hey!  What the hell are you guys doin' on my farm?
"
22,6,Jimbo,"We're trackin' a bear, Randy.
"
22,6,Randy,"A bear?  That didn't sound like no bear. 
"
22,6,Jimbo,"Where're you goin' Ned?
"
22,6,Ned,"Mmm-I'm getting my white ass outta here. 
"
22,6,Stan,"What the fuck?!
"
22,6,Jimbo,"Jesus Christ!  Whoa!
"
22,6,Ned," Help me! 
"
22,6,Jimbo,"NNEEEEDDDD!!
"
22,6,Yates,"All right. We have some dead cows down at Milner's Ranch. I want Conners and Tiggs to check that out. And the two hikers are still missing. Let's have all units keep their ears to the ground.  All right, ladies, that's it. Second shift starts now. As for me, I'm finally heading home.
"
22,6,Officer 1,"Gonna finally get some R&R, sir?
"
22,6,Yates,"Yep. Gonna go home and play me some Red Dead Redemption 2. I got a train to rob in Valentine.
"
22,6,Officer 2,"Detective! Got a call from the school. Another kid's been killed.
"
22,6,Yates,"No, no not another school shooting! Can't they handle it themselves?
"
22,6,Officer 2,"Said they need us right away.
"
22,6,Yates," God damn it!  Why the hell can't these kids stop being a pain in my ass? 
"
22,6,Strong Woman,"Children, everyone, just stay back, okay? The police are coming.
"
22,6,Yates," All right, what happened? What grade was the shooter in?
"
22,6,Strong Woman,"Oh thank God. Some kindergartners found the body. I-I don't think it was a shooting.
"
22,6,Yates," Of course it's a school shooting. It's cut and dry. Let's just get this over with so I can go home. Where's the victim? 
"
22,6,Strong Woman,"Over there. 
"
22,6,Brown,"What the hell? 
"
22,6,Yates,"Jesus, it's a complete mauling.
"
22,6,Officer 3," Looks like part of him was eaten.
"
22,6,Yates," All right, which one of you little shitheads did this?  Come on. I don't have time for these little games. Which of you peckers felt isolated and lashed out at society? If I have to stay here and do an investigation instead of go home and rob a train, there's gonna be serious hell to pay!
"
22,6,Kyle,"So what as he doing alone on the playground?
"
22,6,Cartman,"Staci Nakabw says he just wanted to run back out and get his football.
"
22,6,Kenny,"(What the fuckin' hell, dude?)
"
22,6,Kyle,"And there were bear prints in the snow?
"
22,6,Stan,"It wasn't a bear!  I saw it. 
"
22,6,Kyle,"You saw what?
"
22,6,Stan,"It was at my house. There was a... thing. It attacked my uncle and took his friend. It was like a bear, but a pig... thing.
"
22,6,Kyle,"Jesus.
"
22,6,Stan,"It was at my house, and then here at the school! Everyone says that kid and I looked alike. What if that thing is after me??
"
22,6,Cartman,"Dude, now you're just overreacting.
"
22,6,Mackey," Attention, please. Will the following students report to the principal's office? Eric Cartman, Kenny McCormick.  Thank you, 'kay.
"
22,6,Cartman,"Aww, what did I do this time?
"
22,6,Cartman,"You go first, Kenny.
"
22,6,Kenny,"(Fuck that, you go first!)
"
22,6,Cartman,"I didn't even do anything wrong!
"
22,6,Kenny,"(Neither did I!)
"
22,6,Cartman,"Just stop being a baby, Kenny, and go! 
"
22,6,Yates,"Take a seat, boys. Right there.  You know how shitty it is to be a cop?  There's real emergencies every day - real people who need real help - but then, every other minute, I gotta stop everything 'cause one of you little fuckwads decides to go and shoot up the school.  Shut up! now, which one of you had a beef with Colin Brooks?!
"
22,6,Cartman,"Nobody gives a shit about Colin Brooks.
"
22,6,Yates,"Oh yeah? I asked the kids in this school, ""Who are the biggest loners? Who's most likely to rage and be the next school shooter?"" You know what they said? The fat, ugly mean kid and the detached, loner poor kid.
"
22,6,Cartman,"Hey, I'm not poor, all right?!
"
22,6,Yates,"Or was it both of you? Fess up. I have people in Horseshoe Overlook who are depending on me to get provisions so we can head back east.
"
22,6,Cartman,"You're playing Red Dead Redemption 2?
"
22,6,Yates,"That's right. And I'm gonna make both of you school shooters pay for wasting my time. 
"
22,6,Stan,"Keep looking. There's a lot of people saying they saw it, Kyle. It's not just me.
"
22,6,Kyle,"""Evidence of the creature of South Park."" This is like a conspiracy Web site.
"
22,6,Stan,"It's not a conspiracy, it's real. Keep going down. There's video.  There! Right there!  That's it. That's what I saw.  I saw ManBearPig.
"
22,6,Kyle,"ManBearPig?
"
22,6,Stan,"Don't you remember, dude? We were warned about this. That weirdo guy who came and told us this would happen? He was right. 
"
22,6,Cartman,"You guys! You guys! The police are trying to say me and Kenny killed that douchebag, Colin Brooks.
"
22,6,Kyle,"What?
"
22,6,Cartman,"They questioned us for hours. They said they had enough to get warrants for our arrest.
"
22,6,Stan,"But it wasn't you guys.
"
22,6,Cartman,"We know that! What the hell are we gonna do??
"
22,6,Stan,"Who was that ex-President guy? The one who showed up and tried to convince everyone of a ManBearPig?
"
22,6,Kenny,"(You mean Al Gore?)
"
22,6,Kyle,"Al Gore.
"
22,6,Yates,"In my report, you'll see that Eric Cartman and Kenny McCormick are believed to have worked together. I've issued warrants for their arrests, and this case is now in the hands of the DA.  And I... am finally going home. Keep McCormick and Cartman in separate holding cells, and don't wait on me to book 'em. I'm gonna be playing Red Dead Redemption for the next 18 hours. 
"
22,6,Officer 2,"Detective!
"
22,6,Yates,"Whaaat?
"
22,6,Officer 2,"There's more dead kids. Out in the woods by Stark's Pond.
"
22,6,Yates,"In the woods? There was a school shooting out in the woods? Outside of school is the one place kids are supposed to be safe.
"
22,6,Officer 2,"They're saying it's really bad, sir. Need all units.
"
22,6,Yatess," God damn it!  If these kids don't stop killing each other, I'm gonna shoot 'em all myself.
"
22,6,Stan,"Hello, uh, we're looking for a government sort of guy named Al Gore?
"
22,6,Receptionist,"Al Gore... Al Gore... Sounds familiar.
"
22,6,Kyle,"He said he was almost President once. He came to our town once to warn us about something,  and we have to find him. 
"
22,6,Receptionist,"Ohhh yeahhh. This looks like Jim Turner
"
22,6,Kenny,"{Jim Turner?}
"
22,6,Receptionist,"The state bowling champion five years in a row. You can always catch him practicing down at Gramercy Lanes.
"
22,6,Gore,"Focus. Calm. Center.  Yes! Die! Die, you pins! Oh, we've got a straggler, do we? You're gonna die just like the rest of 'em.
"
22,6,Stan,"Mr. Gore?
"
22,6,Gore,"Focus. Calm.
"
22,6,Stan,"Al Gore?
"
22,6,Gore," That's a name I haven't heard in a long time.
"
22,6,Stan,"I don't know if you remember us, but we're the kids you got to help try and capture ManBearPig? Well uh, eh eh, you were right. Ha, you, you were totally right. ManBearPig is real and, uh, he's killing lots of people in our town.
"
22,6,Gore,"Oh. Sucks for you. 
"
22,6,Kyle,"Please, Mr. Gore! We need your help! ManBearPig isn't going to stop!
"
22,6,Gore," Oh, is it inconvenient now? I tried to warn you all, but no one took me cereal. You all just made fun of me, didn't you? Well, now you can just deal with it yourselves.
"
22,6,Kyle,"Please, just tell us. How do you stop it?
"
22,6,Gore,"You stop it all those years ago when I freaking warned you and you still had time!
"
22,6,Stan,"There has to be something we can still do. Please, Mr. Gore. You're the only person who knows anything about it.
"
22,6,Gore,"Say you're sorry for making fun of me.
"
22,6,Stan,"We, didn't, we didn't realize there were more than-
"
22,6,Gore,"Say you're sorry for making fun of me.
"
22,6,Cartman," We're sorry for making fun of you.
"
22,6,Gore,"That... didn't sound cereal at all. 
"
22,6,Husband,"You can't just go along with what people are saying, Susan. Okay? There's no scientific proof, no real evidence of a Manbearpig.
"
22,6,Susan,"Well, there's a lot of smart people saying ManBearPig is real.
"
22,6,Husband,"Yeah, and a lot of smarter people saying saying it isn't. Okay? What you need to understand, Susan, is that everyone has an agenda. Everyone wants to use the fear of a Manbearpig to get what they want.  So they throw around bad science, bad taxidermy. People comin' out of the woodwork are now experts on the subject.  But you have to use your own brain, sweetheart. You can't just let people tell you that if you don't believe in ManBearPig, then you don't care about the world.
"
22,6,Susan,"It is real!
"
22,6,Husband,"You wanna believe it's real? You go right on ahead, Susan.
"
22,6,Susan,"No, it's right there! It's right there behind you! 
"
22,6,Husband,"Okay, ManBearPig is real.  What are we gonna do about it now, huh?  What are we gonna do that's gonna make any difference now, Susan?
"
22,6,Susan," What?! We have to do something!
"
22,6,Husband,"What can we do that everyone else will also do, Susan?  Come on, use your brain. Even if we do something about it, what about the Chinese?  They're just gonna keep right on- Aaaghghg! 
"
22,6,Boys,"

For he's a jolly good fellow.
For he's a jolly good fellow.
For he's a jolly good fellow.
That should 've been President.


"
22,6,Gore,"Aw, thanks, guys! You shouldn't have!
"
22,6,Cartman,"You told us to.  Ngh!
"
22,6,Gore,"What did you guys get me?  Oh wow. Look!  It's a ""You were right about ManBearPig"" signed picture. 
"
22,6,Kyle,"So, ahum, now maybe we can all work together, huh?
"
22,6,Gore,"Hang on!  It's movie time! Go go! Start it up.  This is the best party ever. Oh, look, guys. It's me! There I am, campaigning to be President.  That's me with Hillary!  There's more of me on the campaign trail,  so full of dreams! Oh, look! It's me when I found out I lost the election!  Boo!  But then look! There's me getting an Academy Award! 
"
22,6,Kyle," Okay, can we stop ManBearPig now?!
"
22,6,Gore,"Who said anything about stopping MBP?
"
22,6,Stan,"Yu-you told us to do all this.
"
22,6,Gore,"Yeah, to make up for ripping on me!
"
22,6,Cartman,"You're still not even gonna help us?!
"
22,6,Gore,"I've moved on from this life, okay?! I have a new life now! I'm a bowler!And when I'm not bowling, I help out my gang. They're my family now! We're wanted in Blackwater, and we have to move our camp soon!
"
22,6,Cartman,"You're playing Red Dead Redemption 2?
"
22,6,Gore,"Yeah, it's amazing. Only thing is I have all these stolen items and I don't know how to sell them.
"
22,6,Stan,"We know how.
"
22,6,Gore," Oh, really? 
"
22,6,Officer 3," No witnesses to the attack were left alive. The same bear and pig droppings were found along with human excrement.
"
22,6,Yates,"I don't believe it. A school shooting at an ice cream shop. Damn it! When children leave school they're supposed to be out of harm's way!
"
22,6,Officer 4,"Detective! Sir, we got word on the two suspects. They appear to be on the run.
"
22,6,Yates,"I would be too if I were guilty.
"
22,6,Officer 4,"No one has seen them or their two closest friends, uh, Marsh and Broflovski.
"
22,6,Yates,"So we got us a gang of shooters, huh?! How the hell hard can it be to find four boys?!
"
22,6,Officer 3,"Sir. Why don't you take a break, sir?
"
22,6,Yates,"Erh.
"
22,6,Officer 3,"You've been hittin' it hard. We'll do all we can to catch these kids. Go home. Play some Red Dead Redemption.
"
22,6,Yates,"Huh. Gotta admit I've to love to see the sunrise over Citadel Rock again. And I got me a gal who claims she's got a side mission or two.
"
22,6,Officer 3,"Go on home, sir. We'll take care of everything here.
"
22,6,Gore,"This is it. Every piece of information I ever gathered on ManBearPig.
"
22,6,Stan,"Where did ManBearPig come from?
"
22,6,Kyle,"Is it some sort of genetic mutation?
"
22,6,Gore," Hoho! I thought that once too. I wanted to find ManBearPig's origins. And so I created this - the Internet. With that, I was able to look everywhere for any bit of data, and what I learned is that ManBearPig... is a demon.
"
22,6,Kenny,"(A demon?!)
"
22,6,Gore," This is ""The Temptation of St. Anthony"" by Martin Schongauer. It depicts several demons. WolfMonekyGuy, ChickenFishWoman, and ElephantPorcupineMan, just to name a few. All of them sent by the Devil himself.  Oh my God.
"
22,6,Kyle,"What?
"
22,6,Gore,"I should play Red Dead on this computer, with all three screens. That'd be so bitchin' sweet.
"
22,6,Stan,"Why did the Devil send ManBearPig?!
"
22,6,Gore,"Why does the Devil do anything? He's the freakin' Devil. He's a dick.  It's probably too late. By now, ManBearPig is so powerful that the only way to get rid of him is to send him back to hell. We're going to have to do... a demonic ritual.  All I can say is... you boys better get to the grocery store, 'cause it's time... to get cereal.
"
22,6,Maggie,"Harrison Yates, where have ya been?!
"
22,6,Yates,"Another school shooting, Maggie. Down at Baskin-Robbins. 
"
22,6,Maggie,"I haven't seen ya in days. I've missed you so much. Come have some supper with me.
"
22,6,Yates,"Maggie, I just need to relax a bit, all right? Please. I've been waiting for this a long time. Just give me a- Wait a minute. The house in Valentine is built? Where did I get a sniper rifle? Maggie! Did you play over my saved game?
"
22,6,Maggie,"I just played a little bit.
"
22,6,Yates,"A little bit, you-? On my saved game?! Why didn't you start your own?!
"
22,6,Maggie,"You're never home anymore! With all these school shootings! I need a life too, you know?! ISo I robbed a lumber mill in Monto's rest, upgraded my horse and got a sniper rifle.
"
22,6,Yates," That's my life, Maggie! I was goin' for more honor points! God damn it!
"
22,6,Maggie,"Why can't we have a life together?!
"
22,6,Yates,"I haven't gotten to play in three days. You've done all this stuff without me! You got deputized?!  Oh God damn it! That does it!
"
22,6,Maggie,"Where are ya going?!
"
22,6,Yates,"I'm starting a new life!  I'm creating a new saved game.
"
22,6,Maggie,"You can;t possibly go all the way back to the snow level again!
"
22,6,Yates,"What choice do I have now?!  Fuckin' bitch.
"
22,6,Gore,"Abuul abash mayah. What Satan has put forth upon this earth, may it be summoned and banished forever. 
"
22,6,Kyle,"Dude, come on. What are we doing?
"
22,6,Cartman,"This is stupid.
"
22,6,Stan,"He was right before.
"
22,6,Gore,"We call upon the powers of darkness. Come on, guys. We call upon the powers of darkness.
"
22,6,The Boys,"We call upon the powers of darkness.
"
22,6,Gore,"Al Gore was right. Al Gore was right all along.
"
22,6,The Boys,"Al Gore was right all along.
"
22,6,Gore,"We should have listened to Al Gore.
"
22,6,The Boys,"We should have all listened to Al Gore.
"
22,6,Kyle,"Wait. Wait, are you videoing us?
"
22,6,Gore,"It's Instagram Live. Keep going! We should have taken Al Gore more cereal.
"
22,6,Stan,"All right all right, that's enough!  You need to stop wasting our time, dude. People are dying! You don't have a fucking clue what you're doing! 
"
22,6,Gore," You were saying?
"
22,6,Stan,"Oh shit!  God damn it! Nothing! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
"
22,6,Yates,"Do you all have any idea what it's like to start over?! You walk four hours through the snow relearning everything, all because your bitch wife went and spent all your hard-earned money on upgrades you didn't want! I get one little break from work - one little break - and I didn't even get back to the first brawl at the saloon!
"
22,6,Officer 5," You can actually bypass that fight if you go hunting with Dutch.
"
22,6,Yates," SHUT UP!! These school shootings are done, you hear me?! I want this case closed by the end of the night, one way or another! Now let's MOVE OUT!
"
22,6,Gore,"Here he comes, boys! Prepare yourselves! 
"
22,6,Satan,"Who hath summoned me to this realm?!
"
22,6,Kyle,"Dude! You summoned Satan!
"
22,6,Gore,"Yeah, no doi! What'd ya think we were doing?!  Prince of Darkness! It is I, Al Gore! I was almost President!
"
22,6,Satan,"What do you wish of me, Al Gore?!
"
22,6,Gore,"A demon from Hell has been unleashed upon our world! We demand to know its nature! We demand to know its reason for coming!
"
22,6,Satan,"There is only one place you can find the answers you seek! It is the place where all knowledge becomes known. Your local library.
"
22,6,Gore,"Ah! You are correct.  Your local library is an excellent resource for whatever you wish to learn.
"
22,6,Satan,"Yes it is.
"
22,6,Gore,"Then I command ye, Satan, to come with us to the local library! And I am cereal!
"
22,6,Kyle,"Dude, Satan's not gonna go with us to the-
"
22,6,Satan,"Very well, Al Gore. Let us go!
"
22,6,Satan,"Yeah, guys! Guys, over here! I think I found it. What you're dealing with is a Sifter of Fate.
"
22,6,Kenny,"(Well what's that mean?)
"
22,6,Satan,"So there's these demons that, um, actually come once every few generations. They're all about making deals.
"
22,6,Stan,"Making deals?
"
22,6,Satan,"Yeah, check it out: ""The Sifter of Fate thrives on tempting mankind. It will always offer a deal in exchange for mercy, but the carnage will be a thousand times worse when the debt comes due.""
"
22,6,Kyle,"Okay, so wait. Now you're saying that someone in our town made a deal with that thing?
"
22,6,Satan,"Now it's here to claim its part of the bargain. It's sort of like when you're part of a gang feuding with a rival gang, you know? You ride around on your horse thinking it won't all catch up with you, but... it always does.
"
22,6,Gore,"You're playing Red Dead Redemption 2?
"
22,6,Satan,"So good, right? 
"
22,6,Yates,"Attention school shooters! We have you surrounded! Come out with your hands up!
"
22,6,Cartman,"Oh Jesus. You gotta tell them, Mr. Gore! Tell them it wasn't us!
"
22,6,Gore,"No. They don't listen to me, kids.  It's up to you young people now.  You have to find a way to get people to take this cereal.  You must convince people there's a ManBearPig, which Satan told you is a Fate Sifter demon that made a deal with someone in this town!
"
22,6,Stan,"That's gonna be impossible!
"
22,6,Gore,"Yeah, sounds really hard, doesn't it? People might not believe you and like, make fun of you and stuff. Poor you guys, huh? 
"
22,6,Officer 5,"They're coming out!
"
22,6,Female officer,"Hands where we can see 'em!
"
22,6,Stan,"Everyone, listen! ManBearPig is real! It's a demon that thrives on making deals to exploit mankind's weaknesses. I am super-duper cereal. We all have to work together, you guys. This one time. We have to all put our pride aside and be willing to say, maybe we were wrong.
"
22,6,Yates," All right, lock these little fuckers up! 
"
22,6,Kyle,"No! You can't! 
"
22,6,Yates," That's it, gentlemen! Case closed. Now I've got a Goddamned stagecoach to rob in Scarlett Meadows!
"
22,6,Officer 6,"Well done, sir! 
"
22,6,Stan,"No! Nooo!
"
22,6,Stan,"Please! Somebody made a deal with ManBearPig! We have to find out who!
"
22,6,Marvin," Billy... What have I done?
"
22,7,Wife," Oh my gosh! Oh, honey! I can't believe you went to Jared!
"
22,7,Husband,"This is a new beginning for us, darling. I'm just so excited for our future. 
"
22,7,Officer Jenkins," Oh yeah! Take that, cop! You want some too, sheriff?! Yeah! There you go, bitch! Another dead cop!  And another one! Yeah! You want some too, copper?!  You want a piece of this, you god damn pigs?! 
"
22,7,Stan,"Officer, you have to let us out of here! We don't have much time!
"
22,7,Jenkins,"Yeah, that's the last cop. Let's get out of here!
"
22,7,Stan,"Sir, you have to listen to us. ManBearPig is real.
"
22,7,Jenkins," Oh God. Here we go again. ""We gotta stop ManBearPig! We gotta take it serious!""
"
22,7,Kyle,"But we do! ManBearPig is gonna kill everyone, and he's not gonna stop!
"
22,7,Jenkins,"Oh, well then I guess I don't have to do anything about it.
"
22,7,Cartman,"Can you get off your god damn video game for five fucking seconds so we can have a conversation?!
"
22,7,Stan," Where the hell is Al Gore? Why isn't he coming for us?
"
22,7,Kyle," Nobody's coming for us, Stan. They think we're murderers.
"
22,7,Cartman,"And that's why we have to break out of here ourselves.  Excuse me? Officer?
"
22,7,Jenkins,"Shut up! I don't wanna hear anything about ManBearPig and how we're all doomed.
"
22,7,Cartman,"No, it's not that. It's just...I noticed you're still riding your horse all the way back to camp.
"
22,7,Jenkins," Yeah. Trains and stagecoaches don't go to my camp.
"
22,7,Cartman,"No, they don't, but... you can use cinematic mode to make it easier on yourself.
"
22,7,Jenkins," What the hell are you talking about?
"
22,7,Hugh,"All right, everyone. I realize a lot of people have died and most of the roads have been destroyed due to all the fires, so I'd like to thank you all for coming to tonight's symposium, ""When Should I Start To Worry?""  I'd like to make this an open discussion and hope we can all participate in ways that give us better insight. Yes, Mr. Clarkson?
"
22,7,Mr. Clarkson," I'm pretty sure there's a ManBearPig and I'm fairly certain that he has eaten two of my children and destroyed our home. When should I start to worry? 
"
22,7,Hugh,"That's an excellent question. There's definitely evidence that all the death and destruction around us is due to a ManBearPig.
"
22,7,Townsman," But no exact correlation to a ManBearPig!
"
22,7,Hugh,"Definitely not, and that's why we're all here, to pinpoint, ""When Should I Start To Worry?""
"
22,7,Stephen,"I think that the time to start worrying is coming. I don't know if I believe in ManBearPig or not, but I do know that I'm open to the idea of starting to worry. 
"
22,7,Hugh,"I think Stephen echoes a lot of our feelings right now.
"
22,7,Satan,"Rroooowwwwwrrrrr!!  Foolish mortals! Your time is nigh! Face your end!
"
22,7,Mr. Clarkson," Um, it looks like Satan is here. Should I start to worry? 
"
22,7,Randy," Stan?!
"
22,7,Stan,"We broke out of jail, Dad.
"
22,7,Randy,"Come on. Get out of sight. 
"
22,7,Stan,"Cartman tricked the guards. We all ran home to be with our parents. Where's mom?
"
22,7,Randy,"Your mom's been out trying to find you a lawyer and a therapist. We've been doing all we can!
"
22,7,Stan,"Dad, that thing we saw take Ned? It was ManBearPig. It was real!
"
22,7,Randy,"What are you talking about? It was just a bear.
"
22,7,Stan,"No, Dad. It's...  Why do you keep looking at the TV?
"
22,7,Randy,"What? Why? I dunno? What?
"
22,7,Stan," You've been playing Red Dead Redemption?!
"
22,7,Randy,"A little bit. I mean... when I'm not doing all this stuff for you
"
22,7,Stan,"I thought you were working on getting me out!
"
22,7,Randy,"Sorry, I needed a little break!
"
22,7,Stan,"You're all the way to St. Denis?! That's like 40 hours of gameplay! How could you uh! Are you high right now?!
"
22,7,Randy,"I'm a little high, yes!
"
22,7,Stan,"Oh my God!
"
22,7,Randy,"Oh what?! I'm sorry! I'm sorry that I need to decompress with all this shit going on!
"
22,7,Stan,"I can't believe you would get high and play video games while your son is in jail! You're such an asshole!
"
22,7,Randy," Well at least I'm not a school shooter!
"
22,7,Stan," It wasn't me! It was a demon named ManBearPig! 
"
22,7,Randy,"Oh whatever!  ""ManBearPig! ManBearPig!"" You sound like your freakin' grandpa!
"
22,7,Stan,"Yeah, because I learned a lot about-!  Whoa whoa, what are you talking about I sound like Grandpa?
"
22,7,Randy,"He had been talking about ManBearPig comin' since I was fuckin' 14. Nothin' new.
"
22,7,Stan," Someone made a deal with it... a long time ago.
"
22,7,Randy,"Do you know how to craft stamina tonics? 
"
22,7,Kyle,"Mom?  Dad?  I don't know if you can hear me. I-I feel so alone right now. I-I feel like the whole world is falling apart and somehow I'm supposed to do something but... I don't know what that is anymore. 
"
22,7,Gore," Fear not. Do not give up on yourself. You must keep believing.
"
22,7,Kyle,"Mr. Gore? Where have you been?!
"
22,7,Gore,"It's me. Al Gore.
"
22,7,Kyle,"Yeah. Where have you been?!
"
22,7,Gore,"You cannot lose faith, my child, even though everyone is ripping on you. Even though they don't believe you and they're saying you're just seeking attention because you lost the Presidency. You have to be strong!
"
22,7,Kyle,"Well what happened to you? Are you dead or something?
"
22,7,Gore,"No! not dead! Just merely using a flashlight on the glass to apply the Pepper's ghost technique.
"
22,7,Kyle,"What, what?  Oh, god damn it. 
"
22,7,Gore,"You see my point? Things aren't always as they appear. You have to stay strong, my little crusader.
"
22,7,Kyle,"I can't do this alone. I need help.
"
22,7,Gore,"I did, too. Didn't get it.
"
22,7,Kyle,"What more do you want from me?? I've atoned for my mistake. I'm sorry that we were getting a lot of different information at the time. You know, even you were wrong about a lot of the things you said would happen a-
"
22,7,Gore," What's that?
"
22,7,Kyle,"Nothing. I didn't mean-
"
22,7,Gore,"See you later, alligator. 
"
22,7,Kyle," No, no, no, no! I'm sorry!  I am sorry, please! I'm cereal! Ah, I didn't mean to say you were wrong, just that some of your predictions didn't happen-
"
22,7,Gore,"Oh yeah, you're real cereal. 
"
22,7,Kyle,"Please, please, please!  I'll do anything! I just want everyone to be safe!
"
22,7,Gore,"All I was doing was trying to be your mentor. You know who my mentor was? Me! Al Gore!
"
22,7,Spirit Gore,"Hello, Al Gore.
"
22,7,Gore," It's him! Just in time, too. Thanks for coming in my time of crisis, Al Gore! 
"
22,7,Officer 7,"Sorry to call you down, sir, but this is a bad one.
"
22,7,Yates,"Oh no, that's fine.  I finally arrest four school shooters and can play some Red Dead Redemption, and then I get a call about another school shooting. 
"
22,7,Officer 7,"This one really doesn't look like a school shooting, sir. Five different witnesses say it was definitely... ManBearPig.
"
22,7,Yates,"God damn it! There's no such thing as a ManBearPig!  You got that?? We're working with facts here, not goofball theories!
"
22,7,Officer 7,"Yea, but sir, all the forensic scientists say there are bear and pig footprints-
"
22,7,Yates,"Fuck scientists!  Why are you trying to figure out what's going with scientists?! The only thing I want to know is who committed this school shooting, since our school-shooting suspects are in jail!
"
22,7,Officer 1,"Detective!  Detective, we just got word from the station. The four shooting suspects broke out a while ago.
"
22,7,Yates,"Oh well, there you go! It was them again! Gee, I didn't need any freakin' scientists to figure that out, did I?! Get 'em outta here!  Now how the fuck did those kids break out of my jail?!
"
22,7,Officer 1,"Jenkins said they tricked him. Said they could show him a way to fast-travel in Red Dead Redemption by upgrading his camp, and then they just took off.
"
22,7,Yates," There's a way to fast-travel if you upgrade your camp?  Jesus...  You'd better start from the beginning.
"
22,7,Reporter," More damage and destruction today as the death toll rises to the hundreds.  Some see this as evidence ManBearPig might be real, while others say ManBearPig is a fabrication for political gains- 
"
22,7,Stan," Grandpa?!  What did you do?
"
22,7,Marvin,"Oh, Billy.  My grandson come to visit.
"
22,7,Stan,"This isn't the first time ManBearPig has shown up, is it?! What happened?!
"
22,7,Marvin,"Billy, I have Alzheimer's. I don't even remember what happened this morning.
"
22,7,Stan,"Cut the shit, Grandpa! You people knew! You made a deal with that thing!
"
22,7,Margaret,"We thought we'd be dead by now. We didn't think we'd have to live to see the consequences.
"
22,7,Marvin,"Aw, great! Just tell the whole world, Margaret! 
"
22,7,Stan," Why did you old people make a deal?!
"
22,7,Marvin,"We had a right to be happy too, you know?!
"
22,7,Stan,"And you just signed away the future?!
"
22,7,Marvin,"We didn't want to have to give the demon his stuff back!
"
22,7,Stan,"What stuff?!
"
22,7,Marvin,"All our cars , and premium boutique ice cream.
"
22,7,Stan,"You couldn't control yourselves, so now that thing is here to kill all of us! Good fuckin' job, Grandpa!
"
22,7,Cartman,"Kyle, come on. We've gotta go.
"
22,7,Kyle,"Go where?
"
22,7,Cartman,"I had a vision, Kyle. Al Gore's ghost visited me.
"
22,7,Kyle,"Al Gore isn't dead.
"
22,7,Cartman,"Well his ghost visited me, Kyle. He said he had a plan, and we needed to go. Are you in or not?
"
22,7,Kenny,"(Yeah, are you in or not?) 
"
22,7,Kyle,"We shouldn't be out here. We're wanted by the police. 
"
22,7,Cartman,"Shhh. What was that?
"
22,7,Kenny,"(Sounds like a fuckin' werewolf!)
"
22,7,Cartman,"This is where Al Gore told me to go. 
"
22,7,Kenny,"(What the fuck is that?!) 
"
22,7,Kyle,"It's Satan.
"
22,7,Cartman,"What are you doing here, Satan?
"
22,7,Satan,"I was told to come here by the spirit of Al Gore.
"
22,7,Cartman,"Us too. But why? 
"
22,7,Spirit Gore,"Remember... even though I am gone, you must still work together.
"
22,7,Kyle,"Work together how??
"
22,7,Spirit Gore,"I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to the ones who are actually cereal.  You cannot lose hope. There is still much you need to know.
"
22,7,Yates,"Oh, you'd better not-  You bitch!  You're playing Red Dead Redemption, aren't you?!
"
22,7,Maggie," So what of it?!
"
22,7,Yates,"What did I tell you about playing on my saved game, Maggie?!
"
22,7,Maggie,"No! No, this is my life now, Harrison Yates! I started over, with me own saved game!
"
22,7,Yates,"What are you talking about?!
"
22,7,Maggie,"See for yourself.  You and all your talk o'wantin' your own life! I wanted somethin' new too!  I started over in the snow and worked my way up to the new gang leader! I have thousands of dollars o'me own! I built a house with John Marston! I'm helpin' his family now!
"
22,7,Yates," You fucking slut!
"
22,7,Maggie,"That's right, Harrison Yates! And what have you got?!  A basic starter horse and the $20 gambler's that you won at a poker match! I'm twice the man you are now!
"
22,7,Yates,"Don't you talk to me like that!
"
22,7,Maggie,"I'll talk however I want!  I've completed every hunting side mission! Found seven legendary animals! 
"
22,7,Yates,"Found them where?!
"
22,7,Maggie,"I'm not tellin'! You wanted your now life and now you got it! 
"
22,7,Yates,"Maggie!  Nwaaahahahahaha...
"
22,7,Gore,"And in conclusion, let me just say that you are the future. You cannot give up hope. I brought you all together because I believe in you.
"
22,7,Cartman,"Okay, but what do you want us to-?
"
22,7,Spirit Gore,"And sometimes, believing is all that we need to be cereal. 
"
22,7,Kyle,"Credits? 
"
22,7,Gore,"Did you guys like my movie?
"
22,7,Cartman,"What are you doing?
"
22,7,Gore,"Exactly. I'm trying to get you to ask ""What would Al Gore do?""
"
22,7,Spirit Gore,"Make a movie starring you.
"
22,7,Gore,"Yes, to get you all to not give up. To get you to fight!
"
22,7,Satan," You don't understand. There is no fight.  A deal was made. We do not know by whom. But this demon has grown stronger, and no mortal can do anything to stop it.
"
22,7,Cartman," No mortal. But what about you?
"
22,7,Satan,"Why would I help mankind?
"
22,7,Cartman,"Satan, come on. Are you really gonna stand there and not say you appreciate all the nice things humans have done for you lately? I mean, not sure if you've noticed, but we're pretty much doing things your way up here
"
22,7,Satan," I... must admit, people up here on Earth have been doing a lot of my work for me lately. Maybe... maybe it is time I did something for them.
"
22,7,Marvin," We were all young and foolish back then, Billy. We didn't think about the future. We just wanted things.  This creature shows up, and it seemed like a good deal for everyone in town.
"
22,7,Stan," You didn't stop to think about what it would mean for us?
"
22,7,Marvin," Aw Billy, it's not that simple. We thought about it. But our town was so tiny back then. We just, we wanted nice things other people had.
"
22,7,Stan,"And you didn't give two shits what it would mean for your grandchildren.
"
22,7,Marvin,"I didn't think I'd have grandkids. I didn't even want children. That's why I always came on Gram Gram's tits.
"
22,7,Stan," Aaaah.
"
22,7,Marvin,"But then, one night, I'm having sex with your grandma, and she sticks her finger in my ass. She had sometimes licked my ass before,  but this was the first time she used her finger, and I came inside her like that.  I pulled out and your grandma was like ""Did you just come in me?"", and I was like ""Well, you stuck your finger in my ass."" And that's basically why you're here, Billy.
"
22,7,Stan,"This is supposed to make me feel better?
"
22,7,Marvin,"I'm just saying that I wasn't thinking about the future because your father was supposed to be nothing but dried-up crust on Gram Gram's titties.
"
22,7,Stan,"You... people... made a deal with ManBearPig! How?! Where?!
"
22,7,Marvin,"It doesn't matter, Billy. It's too late now.
"
22,7,Stan,"Tell me how the deal happened so that I can try to make it go away!
"
22,7,Townsman 2," No! No! 
"
22,7,Satan," ManBearPig!  Aaaargh!!!  Aaaaarch!!! 
"
22,7,Kyle,"Satan!
"
22,7,Satan," H-hey. Hey kids.  I'm sorry.
"
22,7,Kyle," No. Satan, you can't die.
"
22,7,Satan,"Everyone dies. I just wish I could have helped you.  Oh God, it hurts.
"
22,7,Cartman,"We can't do this without you, Satan.
"
22,7,Satan,"You have to. You have to keep trying.
"
22,7,Kyle,"If you can't stop ManBearPig, how can we be-??
"
22,7,Satan,"You have to keep trying!!  You... have to believe. 
"
22,7,Kenny,"(No...)
"
22,7,Townsman 3,"Satan's dead. 
"
22,7,Kyle,"Come back. Come back. 
"
22,7,Satan," Goodbye.
"
22,7,Kyle," Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
"
22,7,Hugh,"And now, on Park County Public access, ""Should We Start To Worry?"" with your host, Jim Kimble.
"
22,7,Jim,"As our town continues to burn to the ground, Satan has been slaughtered and sent to Heaven. Should we start to worry? Joining me now, an expert on our county resources and preparedness, Alec Vaughn. Alec, should we start to worry?
"
22,7,Alec,"Jim, I think we should definitely consider starting to worry. Satan was one of the most powerful entities, supposedly, in the universe, and ManBearPig annihilated him like a bitch. I don't think we should waste any more time underestimating the importance of beginning to think about starting to worry.
"
22,7,Jim,"Also joining us is the former Vice-President, Al Gore. Mr. Gore, do you think it's time for us to deliberate the process of starting to worry?
"
22,7,Spirit Gore,"If by worrying you mean getting cereal, then an empathic ""YES.""
"
22,7,Guest,"I don't think there's any more room for not considering underestimating the importance of beginning to start the process of mulling over the conceptualization of starting to worry. And the time to do it is... very soon.
"
22,7,Gore," Hey, what are you doing?
"
22,7,Spirit Gore,"I'm being a spiritual mentor. These people are depending on me.
"
22,7,Gore,"No, they're depending on me! I'm depending on you, goofball!
"
22,7,Kyle," All right, looks like we're clear.
"
22,7,Cartman,"I can't believe it's the weekend, and I'm at school!
"
22,7,Kyle,"This is the best place to hide.
"
22,7,Cartman,"Why? Of all the places we could hide, why do I have to sit here in school?!
"
22,7,Kenny,"(Yeah!)
"
22,7,Kyle,"Where's the last place anyone would think we would hide? The scene of our supposed crime, dummies! We're safe here.
"
22,7,Cartman,"I'd rather be in jail than at school. 
"
22,7,Kenny,"(Oh shit!)
"
22,7,Stan," Guys? Guys!
"
22,7,Kyle,"Stan!
"
22,7,Stan,"Guys, thank God! Just stay right there, Grandpa!  I know all about the deal. I know what we have to do.
"
22,7,Kyle,"How'd you find us here?
"
22,7,Stan,"I figured you guys would be hiding somewhere. This is the first place I thought to look.
"
22,7,Kenny," (Uh huh!)
"
22,7,Cartman,"Yeah, I guess we're dummies, huh Kenny?
"
22,7,Kenny,"(Yeah, I guess we're dummies.)
"
22,7,Stan,"Guys, listen: my stupid grandpa and a bunch of other old people made the deal with ManBearPig. It's here because of their greediness.
"
22,7,Marvin," Everyone's greedy!
"
22,7,Stan,"Shut up, Grandpa! I know where to go, but I need your help. I'm going to face ManBearPig and put an end to this deal.
"
22,7,Cartman,"Are you crazy? We just saw ManBearPig take down Satan. What the hell are we supposed to do against it?
"
22,7,Stan,"We have to try. 
"
22,7,Officer 8,"Attention school shooters... again. 
"
22,7,Officer 8,"We have you surrounded... again. Come out with your hands up!
"
22,7,Cartman," We just sat in school... for nothing!
"
22,7,Stan,"Listen! We know what to do now!
"
22,7,Officer 8,"Drop to the ground and put your hands on your heads!
"
22,7,Stan,"No! I need to face ManBearPig!
"
22,7,Officer 8,"We have orders! You're coming with us!
"
22,7,Yates,"Belay those orders!  I've been a fool, denying ManBearPig's existence, and I didn't realize it till I went home. My wife... had started a new life without me.. I wanted to give up, but instead, I robbed a bank at St. Denis and a went to an island north of Cuba.  After I came back, that's when it all caught up with me. All the stagecoaches I had robbed, all the horses I had stole, for what?!  We're nothing if we don't believe in each other! And Goddamnit, it's never too late to start trying to do the right thing. You think you know what that is, boys?
"
22,7,Stan,"Yes I do. We're going to face ManBearPig and put an end to this deal once and for all.
"
22,7,Lawyer,"Okay,  sign here and here.  These documents state merely that you've been granted power of attorney by your town and that you wish to attempt to void the current agreement.
"
22,7,Stan,"'Kay.
"
22,7,Lawyer,"Since this is a renegotiation,  you agree that ManBearPig has right to compensation for termination, and you will give up all rights to specified assets. 
"
22,7,Stan,"Yes. Yes, we agree to give back cars and ice cream. 
"
22,7,Lawyer,"Uh, let me confer with my client.  Uh huh. Got it. Yes. My client says that he-  'Kay.  Uh, mm-hmm. ManBearPig has no interest in you giving up cars and ice cream.
"
22,7,Kyle,"Well, what's he want everyone to give up?
"
22,7,Townsman 4,"There! There he is! There he is!
"
22,7,Townsman 5,"Is it over?!
"
22,7,Stan," Um, he says he'll never come back again, but... we have to give up soy sauce and Red Dead Redemption 2.
"
22,7,All,"...Ohhhhh.
"
22,7,Townsman 6,"...Just plain rice?
"
22,7,Stan,"...Yeah, that's what I thought.  Um, could we possibly talk about restructuring a new deal?
"
22,7,Marvin," Uh huh! Uh huh! 
"
22,7,Stan,"No, no. Just like, um, can we do, like, a renegotiation?
"
22,7,Lawyer,"All right, sign here and here  that you are entering a renegotiation with ManBearPig. 
"
22,7,Stan,"Where do I sign that?
"
22,7,Lawyer,"Right there.
"
22,7,Stan,"Okay.
"
22,7,Marvin,"Yeah, I thought so. 
"
22,7,Stan,"Shut up, Grandpa!
"
22,7,Lawyer,"And sign here that ManBearPig has rights to the lives of all the children in Third World countries.
"
22,7,Stan,"'Key, got it.
"
22,7,Lawyer,"And you agree to ignore ManBearPig until he returns in five years, in which time the carnage will be a thousand-fold.
"
22,7,Stan,"'Kay, where do I sign that?
"
22,8,Cartman,"I don't know where to start. First, it was all the school shootings, then these Wi-Fi scooters showed up, and now we know that ManBearPig is real and we could all be dead in a matter of years.
"
22,8,Doctor," And you believe this all relates somehow to the movie Black Panther not being as good as everyone says it was?
"
22,8,Cartman,"I know there's a connection. But that isn't what matters. I can't deal with people anymore. It's just... everyone sucks so hard, you know? Everybody is so stupid. And they all walk around going ""Nya na chai cha nyachacha chai cha."" And the only thing that makes me happy, the only thing I can trust... is this.  But... all people do is try to keep me from it. 
"
22,8,Cartman,"I'll be in my room and my mom will come in and say...
"
22,8,Liane,"""Eric, that's enough time on your phone!"" 
"
22,8,Cartman,"And then at school...
"
22,8,Mrs. Nelson," ""Eric!""  ""What are you doing? You can't use your phone at school!"" 
"
22,8,Cartman,"And even my friends. My own friends! They'll be like...
"
22,8,Stan," ""Hey Cartman! Throw us the ball. You're the goddamn quarterback!"" 
"
22,8,Cartman,"It's like, everybody needs something from me. All I want is a little time with my phone instead of always listening to people's needy bullshit. 
"
22,8,Doctor,"Oh ahh, d'ya, sorry. Just...  Uh, well, you know, young people have so much to deal with today. I believe that what you have is... anxiety.
"
22,8,Cartman,"Anxiety? Is that cool?
"
22,8,Doctor,"It's pretty common these days. What it really is, more than anything is an excuse to be lazy and lame to everyone around you.
"
22,8,Cartman," Oh my God, that's perfect!
"
22,8,PC Principal,"I'm busy. 
"
22,8,Ms. Blaze,"Mr. Principal?
"
22,8,PC Principal,"I'm busy doing stuff!  What?!
"
22,8,Ms. Blaze,"The vice principal needs to speak with you. She says it's urgent. 
"
22,8,Mr. Mackey," Oh, PC Principal!
"
22,8,PC Principal,"Uh-uh yes?
"
22,8,Mr. Mackey,"Are you going in to see the vice principal? I really need to speak with her.
"
22,8,PC Principal,"Uh yeah, we just uh, we're having an important scheduling to go over.
"
22,8,Mr. Mackey,"Everything is okay with you two? There's no more ""inappropriate behavior""? You know, as a counselor, I'm here to-
"
22,8,PC Principal,"That's in the past, Mackey! We've paid our dues, and we're not hiding anything anymore.
"
22,8,Mr. Mackey,"Mmm-m'kay. 
"
22,8,Strong Woman," I could use a little help here!
"
22,8,PC Principal,"What's going on??
"
22,8,Strong Woman,"Riley said a word her sister felt was insensitive to Muslims. Now they're all upset.
"
22,8,PC Principal,"All right, what word did you use, Riley?!
"
22,8,Strong Woman,"She just said ""Aba daba.""
"
22,8,PC Principal,"Look, can't we put them in a daycare?
"
22,8,Strong Woman,"Oh, yeah. That would be really smart. If anybody sees them, they're gonna figure out you're the father.
"
22,8,PC Principal,"Well maybe they won't!
"
22,8,Strong Woman,"You wanna risk that? The babies have to stay hidden because if people know the truth, then you're not PC and I'm not strong! 
"
22,8,Waiter," All right, can I take your order?  Excuse me.  What would you like, sir?
"
22,8,Cartman,"Just a God- can you wait?! Isn't that your job?! Aren't you a wait-er?! 
"
22,8,Diner,"Hey, could you turn your phone down, kid? This is a restaurant.
"
22,8,Cartman,"It just so happens I have anxiety! That means I have trouble being around assholes who won't leave me alone! 
"
22,8,Tele's owner,"Oh, hello, Eric.
"
22,8,Cartman,"Shut up. I have anxiety. 
"
22,8,Pedestrian,"Hey kid!  Hey kid!
"
22,8,Cartman," I'm on my phone!!
"
22,8,Pedestrian,"You're about to get hit by a car! 
"
22,8,Cartman," All right, that's it! Everyone stop! Just fucking stop right now!  Listen up, people! I have anxiety! That means I'm in my shell and have a hard time expressing myself! I find it difficult to engage with others! So everyone shut the fuck up because my anxiety is up here right now!
"
22,8,Announcer,"We live in a world of many distractions. It's hard to find peace.
"
22,8,Announcer,"In the hustle and bustle of modern times, we've lost the one thing we all need. . More quality one-on-one time with our phone.
"
22,8,Announcer,"But now you can have it with Buddha Box.  Simply fit the patented box on your head and set its Bluetooth to your mobile device.
"
22,8,Announcer,"Inside Buddha Box, your phone is projected two inches from your face, and the noise-canceling headphones let you hear your phone without any outside noise, giving you peace from...
"
22,8,Announcer,"That annoying Uber driver who wants to talk. 
"
22,8,Announcer,"Those people at work who act like they need stuff. 
"
22,8,Man,"I want to be enlightened, like the Buddha, but I've got these fucking kids.
"
22,8,Announcer,"Let Buddha Box take you to a place of peace and serenity,  where you can have quality, uninterrupted time with your phone.
"
22,8,Woman,"I was stressed out and feeling anxious. After just 8 to 10 hours in Buddha Box, I feel refreshed and ready to take on anything.
"
22,8,Husband,"Babe, can you please come say hi to my mother while she's here? 
"
22,8,Announcer," Order Buddha Box today and you too can have that quiet, quality time with your phone. Like... the Buddha. 
"
22,8,Kyle,"What the hell is that?
"
22,8,Stan,"I think it's Cartman.
"
22,8,Kyle,"What is it doing?
"
22,8,Cartman," Ha! That's so sweet!  That video seriously made me laugh!  Let me check my e-mail again!  Oh man, nothing from Lorenz yet? Whatever. Weak. Oh! I gotta see that post from Clyde again! 
"
22,8,Craig,"Dude!  Dude, what the hell are you doing?!
"
22,8,Cartman,"What? What? Who is that?
"
22,8,Craig,"Get off of me!!
"
22,8,Cartman," Oh, sorry Craig. Didn't see you there.
"
22,8,Craig,"Yeah, 'cause you got a stupid box on your head! 
"
22,8,Cartman,"Oh, there's nothing stupid about it. Don't you wish you had a way to deal with your anxiety?
"
22,8,Craig," My anxiety?
"
22,8,Cartman,"I see it in you, Craig. With your parents and relationships? Imagine being able to shut them out for a little while, Craig, so you can focus on what matters. With Buddha Box you can cut out all the unwanted noise. Not have to deal with conversations that are of no interest to you.
"
22,8,Craig,"Well, I have to admit: sometimes, when me and Tweek are together it's... it's like he wants my atten- 
"
22,8,Ms. Nelson,"All right, children, we have a lot to go over for today's quiz. Who can tell me where we left off?  Eric.  Eric Cartman.
"
22,8,Cartman," Thirty-four million dollars box office? How the hell does Creed II do $34 million opening weekend?  What's the weather like tomorrow?  Oh, it's snowing? I gotta tell Lorenz. I-  Whoa, whoa! Hey!
"
22,8,Mrs. Nelson," What do you think you're doing?
"
22,8,Cartman,"Excuse me, that's my Buddha Box.
"
22,8,Ms. Nelson,"You aren't using this during class time.
"
22,8,Cartman,"It relaxes me. Ask my therapist. I have anxiety, you dumb bitch! 
"
22,8,PC Principal,"I don't know what makes you think you're different from everyone else, but nobody gets away with slandering teachers at this school!
"
22,8,Cartman," Uhuh. Aw man, that looks, that looks sweet.
"
22,8,PC Principal,"Hey!  HEY! 
"
22,8,Cartman,"Oh, PC Principal. Hello.
"
22,8,PC Principal,"Just what do you think you're doing?
"
22,8,Cartman," I'm letting go of stress and being calm, like the Buddha.
"
22,8,PC Principal,"There are no boxes on your head in school!
"
22,8,Cartman,"Hey. Whoa man, what's going on? Are you suffering from anxiety?
"
22,8,PC Principal,"What are you talking about?
"
22,8,Cartman,"It's okay. I have it too. Anxiety is very real. But there is help for people like us.
"
22,8,Strong Woman,"What the fuck are you doing?!  Hey! What the fuck are you doing?!
"
22,8,PC Principal,"Oh hey, I just needed to answer a couple of e-mails really fast.
"
22,8,Strong Woman,"With a box on your head?!
"
22,8,PC Principal,"I got one for you, too.  It's Buddha Box.  Look, you and I have been having a lot of problems. Clearly, what we both need is more quality one-on-one time with our phones.
"
22,8,Strong Woman,"I don't need a box on my head to use the phone!
"
22,8,PC Principal,"I'm sorry!  I was trying to be helpful! 
"
22,8,Strong Woman,"All right, Riley. Give that back to your brother.  Bailey, no!  Harper, don't! Har-per! 
"
22,8,All,"
PC Babies


"
22,8,Lead Singer,"
They're comin' to your town


"
22,8,All,"
PC Babies


"
22,8,Lead Singer,"
The wokest kids around
When there's something problematic
They're sure to let you know.
Making things fun and gender-neutral


"
22,8,All,"
Everywhere they go
They're everybody's fave-sies
They're PC babies, yeah!


"
22,8,Patron 1,"Hey Mike. What's that you're drinking?
"
22,8,Mike,"This? Oh, it's a Cosmopolitan. I know, I know, it's a pussy drink. 
"
22,8,Patron 2," Hey, be careful, guys. There are some PC babies over there. 
"
22,8,Mike,"Oh great. Come on, I didn't mean pussy drink as in female genitalia.  Okay, I'm sorry! I'll order a Black Russian! 
"
22,8,Barkeep,"Hey, what's all that racket down there?!
"
22,8,Patron 1,"Oh, there's some PC babies upset about certain drink descriptions.
"
22,8,Barkeep,"Fine, we'll take them off the menu.
"
22,8,Patron 1,"Who's makin' a difference? Who's the future? 
"
22,8,Kyle,"Here it comes! Block it!  What the fuck, dude?!
"
22,8,Tolkien,"What is your goddamn problem?! 
"
22,8,Cartman," What's going on?
"
22,8,Kyle,"They just scored again, you fat fuck!
"
22,8,Cartman,"Oh, I'm sorry! I'm sorry I'm dealing with my anxiety! Do you know how hard it is for people with my condition to come out and even do things like this?! Living with anxiety is awful, huh Craig? 
"
22,8,Kyle,"Can we get another goalie, please?!
"
22,8,Cartman,"Oh yeah! Sure! Yeah, because people with anxiety shouldn't be allowed to play sports! Right, Kyle?!  You know, our world is dark and scary enough without people like you making us feel inferior.  Asshole! 
"
22,8,Tolkien,"Fuck this!  My parents didn't come here to see their son lose by 20 points! Come on, Dad. Let's go!  Dad? 
"
22,8,Strong Woman,"River?? Bailey?! Emory?!
"
22,8,PC Principal,"It's okay. We're gonna find them.
"
22,8,Strong Woman,"I can't believe you were on your phone!
"
22,8,PC Principal,"You were on your phone too!
"
22,8,Strong Woman,"It was my time to be on the phone! You were on yours all morning!
"
22,8,PC Principal,"You're seriously gonna make this all my fault?!
"
22,8,Strong Woman,"Yes!
"
22,8,PC Principal,"Because last time I checked, you didn't even want me around as a partner to the PC Babies, even though I-
"
22,8,Strong Woman," Oh God, I'm not doing this again.
"
22,8,PC Principal,"Even though you need me to do shit for you every  10 fuckin' minutes! You don't get to just say whatever you-  Oh. Okay, cool. Fine with me! I'm the one who has a fuckin' problem on their fuckin' phone!  You know, usually, I'm afraid to tell you what I really think, but you wanna know something?  You wanna- you wanna know what I really think? 
"
22,8,Doctor,"Anxiety can make you feel unable to cope. But living with someone who has anxiety can be a bit of a roller coaster as well. We have to support our loved ones with their anxiety and try to understand their illness.
"
22,8,Tweek,"I just feel that Craig has changed so much lately! He barely even talks to me anymore!
"
22,8,Doctor,"Well, because his anxiety make him feel like anything he says might sound wrong. That's why we must nurture our loved ones, so they feel safe.
"
22,8,Liane,"Eric, I just feel like you have so much to offer the world, and it kills me that you're so afraid to let your inner you shine.
"
22,8,Cartman," Heh heh, that guy's such a douche. What was that... what was that one show he was on?
"
22,8,Doctor,"Maybe you, you wanna text him that? 
"
22,8,Cartman,"Oh yeah, that's it. B.J. and the Bear. That show was so dumb. What kind of monkey was that, anyway? What was that- what was that monkey he always had- Wait. What the? What the hell is this? Oh God damnit.  Mom, will you stop texting me? I'm trying to relax!
"
22,8,Doctor,"Look, we're all just trying to understand this condition, and it's like you're not listening!
"
22,8,Cartman,"We're doing everything we can to keep our anxiety under control! Do you think I even wanna be here right now?! I am freaking out!
"
22,8,Tolkien,"Can we go now?
"
22,8,Cartman," Heheh, yeah. That's pretty cool.
"
22,8,Foreman,"Hey! Hey, what's goin' on here?! Why aren't you people workin'?!
"
22,8,Laborer 1,"We can't keep buildin', sir. We got a bunch of protesters who won't let us work.
"
22,8,Foreman,"Protesters? Who?
"
22,8,Laborer 1,"Ah, it's just a bunch of PC babies who think building this thing is wrong. 
"
22,8,Foreman,"All right, all right! What do you PC babies want? 
"
22,8,Laborer 1,"I guess they're upset because the new viaduct is being financed by a state rather than a county institution.
"
22,8,Foreman,"Aw, come on PC Babies! Why does that matter?! 
"
22,8,Laborer 1,"I guess the state refused to finance a proposed program on race-relation education, an they see it as hypocritical.
"
22,8,Foreman,"God damnit, not everyone cares about race-relation programs! Come on, PC Babies! We got a job to do! 
"
22,8,Desk Officer,"All right, all right, just calm down, lady! You want to file a missing persons report?
"
22,8,Strong Woman,"No! No, we don't want to file anything specific. We just need help finding some PC babies.
"
22,8,Desk Officer,"PC babies? They usually hang out at the liberal arts colleges. You could find some there.
"
22,8,Strong Woman,"Nono, it's five specific PC babies.
"
22,8,Desk Officer,"Tony, wasn't there a report of some PC babies down at the Mexican border?
"
22,8,Strong Woman,"No! No, these PC babies wouldn't have gotten that far! They can barely walk. I'm their mother.
"
22,8,Desk Officer,"Hokay, okay. Last name?
"
22,8,Strong Woman,"Woman.
"
22,8,Desk Officer,"First name?
"
22,8,Strong Woman," Strong.
"
22,8,Desk Officer,"Okay, and you're the father?
"
22,8,Both,"NO!
"
22,8,PC Principal,"I'm her superior at work!
"
22,8,Strong Woman,"Don't be ridiculous!
"
22,8,PC Principal,"You think I took advantage of my position?!
"
22,8,Strong Woman,"I'm not some two-bit floozy who goes around sleeping with her boss! I am a strong woman! Those kids were born naturally by in-vitro fertilization. 
"
22,8,PC Principal,"I'm not Harvey Weinstein, all right?! I have nothing but respect for females at my workplace, and I would never compromise that position!
"
22,8,Strong Woman,"We'll uh, see what we can do. In the meantime you'll just have to take a seat and wait. 
"
22,8,Kyle,"Go!  GO! 
"
22,8,Cartman,"What do you want?
"
22,8,Kyle,"Go down the slide or get out of the way!
"
22,8,Cartman,"You think I even want to be here, Kyle?! My therapist told me I need to force myself to go out and do things to overcome my anxiety!
"
22,8,Kyle," Can we move him, please?! 
"
22,8,Cartman,"Oh! Oh, I see! People with anxiety shouldn't be allowed at water parks. Is that it, Kyle?  Hey everybody! Just so you know, Kyle thinks people with anxiety should just stay home! Yeah! I'm trying to come out of my shell, but Dr. Kyle here is just worried about his place in line.
"
22,8,Kyle," Get! Off! My! Towel!  Get off my towel!
"
22,8,Cartman,"God damnit! I seriously can't get a minute of peace!  Why is it that people who don't have a Buddha Box are always flipping Buddha Boxes off the heads of people with anxiety?!
"
22,8,Kyle," I got news for you, Cartman! Everyone has anxiety! Everyone gets nervous! Everyone is afraid being around people! Everyone has feelings they'd rather stay home alone! And you know what they do? They get over it. And they stop being a piece of shit! 
"
22,8,Cartman," Everyone has anxiety?
"
22,8,Kyle,"Yes!
"
22,8,Cartman,"Oh my God. I know what I have to do now. Yo-you're right, Kyle! You're right! 
"
22,8,Kyle,"What? No. No! What did I just do?
"
22,8,Stan,"Should have just let him be on his phone, dude.
"
22,8,Record Producer,"You know what the kids like today? They like music that matters! I think you guys got what it takes to be the next big thing! The PC Babies!  That's what I'm talkin' about! That stuff is raw! Everyone loves you, PC Babies! We're gonna make you famous!
"
22,8,Bruce,"All right, PC Babies, let's hear what you got. 
"
22,8,DJ,"All right, South Park, and now here's that special treat we told you about. Live with us in the studio is a hot new band: The PC Babies. They're gonna perform their new song, which is about the injustice of white people in dreadlocks. It's called ""Weeaaagh."" 
"
22,8,Strong Woman," Riley?
"
22,8,PC Principal," Tha-that's Bailey!
"
22,8,Desk Officer," It's the PC Babies. Guess they're all the rage now.
"
22,8,PC Principal,"Cone on! 
"
22,8,Cartman,"To quiet one's mind, one must have a dialog with one's self. I have found enlightenment. But there are so many others who suffer. It's very important to take the time to shut out the outside world. In the Hindu religion, there's a saying, ""Namaste."" It means ""fuck you, I have anxiety."" At first I thought it was only a few of us, but then something was said to me by Kyle. He said ""Eric, my friend, everyone has anxiety."" I know what you're thinking: ""Fuck Kyle."" And normally I would agree with you, but hear his words. Everyone has anxiety. We must recognize this disease as an epidemic. Yes, fuck Kyle, but Mayor, we have to raise money to get everyone who has anxiety the tools they need to cope.
"
22,8,Mayor McDaniels,"And how do YOU think we get that money? How do YOU suggest we do this?
"
22,8,Cartman,"Namaste.
"
22,8,Johnson,"Na-ma-ste.
"
22,8,Cartman,"Fuck you too.
"
22,8,Record Producer,"That was far out, PC Babies! You really rocked the airwaves! Now come on! We got a photo shoot at 5! 
"
22,8,PC Principal,"Kids! 
"
22,8,Strong Woman,"You're okay! Thank God!
"
22,8,Record Producer,"Who the hell are you??
"
22,8,Strong Woman," I'm their... vice principal.
"
22,8,PC Principal,"Yea, and ah-I'm their principal. We need to get these kids back to school.
"
22,8,Record Producer,"You can't do that! These are the PC Babies! Don't you know how big they are?! In just one day they protested a bar, stopped construction of a problematic viaduct, and wrote a hit single about cultural appropriation!
"
22,8,Strong Woman,"They.... did all that?
"
22,8,PC Principal,"Oh my God. They had their first protests... and we missed it. We missed everything because... we were on our phones.
"
22,8,Strong Woman,"I've always used the phone as a way to deal with the stress of having babies nobody could know the truth about, but... it's only made it worse.
"
22,8,PC Principal,"You know what we have to do, right?
"
22,8,Strong Woman,"Yeah, I think so.
"
22,8,PC Principal,"All right everyone, listen up. The vice principal and I have been discussing student health, and it's our firm belief that they need, and what we all need, is less time on our phones.  Yes, yes I know it's an unpopular idea, but just hear me out, please. Our phones are the cause of stress, not the relief from it. We are banning phones and Buddha Boxes, and we suggest you all strictly limit their use at home as well. 
"
22,8,Strong Woman," I don't think anyone's listening to you.
"
22,8,PC Principal,"Yeah... Nobody's listening. And nobody's watching. 
"
22,8,Strong Woman,"I guess we can wait and ban the boxes tomorrow? 
"
22,8,Brad Paisley,"
You keep brushing that hair back out of your eyes
And it just keeps falling and so do I
I am feeling like the luckiest man alive
Today
And I don't know about tomorrow
Right now the whole world feels right
And the memory of a day like today
Can get you through the rest of your 
life


"
22,9,Butters,"Oh, boy! This is looking so great.  Hey, Dad! The big bike parade is this weekend. How's it look? First prize is $50!
"
22,9,Stephen," What are you saying, that our family needs cash?! I'm busting my ass trying to make ends meet! You wanna go live with Kim Kardashian?! She's better than me 'cause she's got money?! Fuck you, son! 
"
22,9,Linda,"Butters really loves that bike parade.
"
22,9,Stephen," I don't need to be reminded every ten minutes that money's tight!  I'm sorry. It's just this new job. It can be such a grind.
"
22,9,Linda," You work too hard at that place.
"
22,9,Stephen," Kids these days just don't understand how much their parents break their back to provide.
"
22,9,Gruff Worker," Come on, Stotch! 
"
22,9,Stuart,"You're drivin' carpool today or not?
"
22,9,Gruff Worker,"Gotta get down factory before the bell!
"
22,9,Stephen," Goodbye, Linda.
"
22,9,Linda,"Don't let that place work you to death.
"
22,9,Tennessee Ernie Ford,"
Some people say a man is made outta mud
A poor man's made outta muscle and blood
Muscle and blood and skin and bones
A mind that's a-weak and a back that's strong

You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

I was born one mornin' when the sun didn't shine
I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine
I loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal
And the straw boss said ""Well, a-bless my soul""

You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

I was born one mornin', it was drizzlin' rain
Fightin' and trouble are my middle name
I was raised in the canebrake by an ol' mama lion
Can't no-a high-toned woman make me walk the line

Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go

"
22,9,Butters," Yeah! Yippie!  Hey, fellas, what'dya think? 
"
22,9,Stan,"Think about what?
"
22,9,Butters,"How my decorations are coming. The big bike parade is this weekend.
"
22,9,Cartman,"Bike parade? That's so dumb.
"
22,9,Butters,"Well, you won't think it's dumb when I win first prize. I'm goin' all out this year. I'll finally beat Larry Zewiski.
"
22,9,Stan,"Dude, nobody cares about a stupid bike parade.
"
22,9,Larry,"Hey, Stotch!  You gettin' pumped for the big bike parade?  Yeah, I'm pretty excited, I guess.
"
22,9,Porsche,"Wow! Hey, nice bike, Larry.
"
22,9,Mercedes,"Are you gonna be in the bike parade?
"
22,9,Larry,"Yeah, I'm thinkin' about it.  Come on, girls. I'll show you my blue ribbons. Later, Stotch. Sucka! 
"
22,9,Butters," Well, anyway...  well, I'm gettin' some more things for my bike too.  Um... I'll see ya, fellas. 
"
22,9,Stephen,"So this is where all the main boxing and transferring happens. I'm excited to have you guys working here at the fulfillment center, Mr. and Mrs. Tweek.
"
22,9,Richard,"We really didn't have a choice. Since the fulfillment center opened, me and my wife's coffee business has gone belly-up.
"
22,9,Stephen,"Yeah, people are ordering everything online these days. That's why you'll find a lot of familiar faces working here.  Everything's automated and timed to precision to get people's orders out to them as soon as possible. This is Josh, he'll be your section manager.
"
22,9,Josh,"Howdy, folks.
"
22,9,Stephen,"In these warehouses, there are over one million items, from toothpaste to Go Karts, and it's the work of both humans and machines that make the work possible.  You'll get a message on your device which item to get, then get it to one of our loaders, and the machines do the rest. 
"
22,9,Bearded Worker,"We got another one!
"
22,9,Stephen,"Josh!  Hang on, Josh!  Shut it down! Shut it down! 
"
22,9,Beefy Worker,"It's not shuttin' down. 
"
22,9,Josh,"Aaaarargargar!
"
22,9,Stephen,"Whenever there's a workplace accident, you need to fill out a 1081 form.  
"
22,9,Cartman,"What are you doing?
"
22,9,Kenny," (What?! You scared me, guys! Wassup?)
"
22,9,Stan,"""Wassup"" is I thought we agreed bike parades are stupid.
"
22,9,Kenny,"(Bike parades ARE stupid.)
"
22,9,Cartman,"Don't lie, Kenny! You saw that Larry kid scoring chicks with his bike, heard about the cash prize, and you decided to do the bike parade behind our backs! I know 'cause I thought the same thing!
"
22,9,Stan,"Me too.
"
22,9,Cartman," Jesus. Is this really what it's come down to, you guys? Whatever happened to *us*?
"
22,9,Kyle,"What do you mean?
"
22,9,Cartman,"It used to always be the four of us. Always. Now Stan's moved to a farm. I have anxiety. Kenny? Nobody really talks to Kenny. And then there's just... Kyle. We used to do everything together. What if we did this like the old days?
"
22,9,Kyle," Four bikes, one common theme.
"
22,9,Stan,"We could totally own the bike parade.
"
22,9,Kenny,"(Yeah!)
"
22,9,Cartman,"If we order everything online, we can have it delivered tomorrow!  We need props, pyrotechnics, the works!
"
22,9,Stan," Yeah, and we gotta order some badass spokes and those wheel bumpers!
"
22,9,Kyle," I'll start looking for costumes! What theme are we thinking?
"
22,9,Cartman,"Kenny, get on your mom's laptop and start ordering streamers, sparklers and rockets! Make sure everyone ships Next Day Delivery! This is gonna be just like the old times, you guys!
"
22,9,Irish Singers,"
Workin' me fingers to the bone, 
I need me a drink before goin' home.
Be back in the mornin', 
pack boxes at dawn. 
Workin' for Amazon


"
22,9,Stephen,"Can I have a beer, please? Whatcha got on tap?
"
22,9,Barkeep,"Amazon, Amazon light, and Amazon IPA.
"
22,9,Stephen,"Gimme Amazon Light. I'm a Prime member. 
"
22,9,Gruff Worker," What the fook are we doin', anyway? Breakin' our backs! Loadin' up forklifts! Gettin' paper cuts from boxes! And for what?! A measly paycheck that just barely covers our online purchases.
"
22,9,Stephen,"Yeah, well, we should be thankful we even have jobs, huh? Before the fulfillment center opened, we really didn't have anything.
"
22,9,Gruff Worker,"We had our dignity!
"
22,9,Stuart," Hey everyone! Everyone, listen!  Amazon just posted a statement about Josh's accident. They're calling it ""human error""  ""Amazon regrets the recent workplace accident and is working to better train its workers so that no future accidents occur.""
"
22,9,Bearded Worker,"Who do they think they are?!
"
22,9,Gruff Worker,"It was the bloody machines!
"
22,9,Stephen," Okay, hold on, everyone. I'm sure there's an explanation.
"
22,9,Stuart,"This is what we've been reduced to! We are the backbone that makes the fulfillment center work! Maybe they should see what it would be like if we didn't show up for work! 
"
22,9,Skeeter,"We'll do it for Josh, and so what happened to him never happens to anyone else.!
"
22,9,Stephen,"Hold on, guys.  M-My son has a big bike parade coming up. I... I can't just not show up to work now.
"
22,9,Stuart," What's more important to you, Stotch? A bike parade, or Josh?!
"
22,9,Stephen,"A bike parade.
"
22,9,Stuart,"Amazon workers, we are on strike! 
"
22,9,Cartman,"My stuff's here!  My stuff! My stuff! My stuff my stuff my stuff! 
"
22,9,Liane,"Mornin' hon.
"
22,9,Cartman,"Shut up!  Stuff?  Stuff?  Mom, were there a bunch of packages for me?
"
22,9,Liane,"I don't think anyone's getting packages, sweetie. Look. 
"
22,9,Tom,"The Amazon Fulfillment Center has been shut down as hundreds of employees refuse to work.  Customers all over the state are wondering where their Amazon orders are, as workers demand more respect and more money. The uprising started with a workplace accident which Amazon blamed on human error. Joining me now is the victim of the accident - Josh Carter.  And Josh, how does it feel to have your accident spark so much upheaval?
"
22,9,Josh,"You know, Tom, I think something like this was bound to happen. There's those at the top who control the means of production, and then there's the working class that enables those means by selling their labor power for wages. When there's conflict, the ruling class tries to blame the working class.
"
22,9,Tom,"Can you get out of the box?
"
22,9,Josh,"No, my organs have been compacted, so if the box opens, I spill out and die. I believe the working class needs to revolt against capitalism and bring about socioeconomic emancipation.
"
22,9,Tom,"Do you get hot in the box?
"
22,9,Mayor McDanniels," Ship to address, order now...  ""Usually ships in...""  four to six weeks?! I can make my own damn towels in four to six weeks! 
"
22,9,Janson,"Mayor, you have a visitor.
"
22,9,Mayor,"Not now, I'm having problems!
"
22,9,Janson," But Mayor, it's uh,  Jeff Bezos.
"
22,9,Mayor," Founder and CEO of Amazon Jeff Bezos?
"
22,9,Janson," Yeah.
"
22,9,Mayor,"Okay, okay, uh, let him in.
"
22,9,Janson,"Right on through here, Mr. Bezos. 
"
22,9,Mayor," Mr. Bezos. How great to see you again!  How have you been?
"
22,9,Bezos," I wish I was doing better. Please Mayor, have a seat.
"
22,9,Mayor,"Oh, thank you. 
"
22,9,Mayor,"I guess you're here because of the... strike.
"
22,9,Bezos,"We had a deal, Mayor. You told me this town would be the perfect place for one of our fulfillment centers.
"
22,9,Mayor,"And it has been. It it gave so many people jobs.  And I'm not really sure why everyone is so...
"
22,9,Bezos," Disgruntled? Dissatisfied? Unamused? Would you like to know why Amazon is so successful? Because the customer is all that matters. Now orders are going unfulfilled all over the state of Colorado.  That makes us look very bad.  It makes YOU look very bad. Perhaps... you should no longer be a Prime member.
"
22,9,Mayor," Please! I-I'm trying to get everyone back to work. I-I'm going to do everything that I can.
"
22,9,Bezos,"Then we have an understanding.  Goodbye, Mayor. If everyone stays unfulfilled,  it will be you who pays the price. 
"
22,9,Trey,"
Unfulfilled.
And now tomorrow's nothing but another day.
Somebody came and took my hopes and dreams away.
and now I'm lost, and unfulfilled.

Curtains close
All we were a distant memory
Somebody just bitch-slapped the smile right off of me.
And here I am, so unfulfilled.

The happiness I knew just got raped and killed.
And all I am is unfulfilled.

Nothing that I have seems like enough
All I'm left to ask is, ""Where's my stuff?""
It's sitting somewhere, unfulfilled.


"
22,9,Stan,"Anything? Did you get anything?
"
22,9,Kenny,"(No. Nothing.) 
"
22,9,Cartman,"I guess it's time to face it. We aren't going to get our stuff.
"
22,9,Stan,"Maybe if we reorder everything and have it shipped to a different fulfillment center-
"
22,9,Kyle,"There's no time. Let's face it. We can't be in the bike parade.
"
22,9,Stan,"No! I refuse to believe we have no other options. Um, what...? What did we do before Amazon?
"
22,9,Kenny,"(Well I don't know.)
"
22,9,Stan,"I mean, before we could get whatever we wanted, where did we get stuff?
"
22,9,Cartman,"At the... the ma-, the ma-ma-, the mall.
"
22,9,Kyle,"Oh yeah! The mall!
"
22,9,Kenny,"(The mall!)
"
22,9,Cartman,"Guess we haven't been to the mall in a while. 
"
22,9,Anita Baker,"
Sweet Love
hear me callin' out your name
I feel no shame; 
I'm in love
Oh no no no no no
(Sweet Love)


"
22,9,Kyle,"There's nobody here.
"
22,9,Stan,"There's gotta be somebody.
"
22,9,Cartman," Look! It's Wiener On A Stick. 
"
22,9,Stan,"Uh, hello?
"
22,9,Mall Worker 1," Welcome to Wiener On A Stick.
"
22,9,Kyle,"Are you the only one still at the mall?
"
22,9,Mall Worker 1,"There are many, and yet none. 
"
22,9,Linda,"There he is! 
"
22,9,Butters,"Dad! 
"
22,9,Linda,"How did it go?
"
22,9,Stephen," They voted to keep striking. There was a run-in, violence between some of the strikers and corporate. They've decided to punish us by taking our status.  There's no easy way to say this, so I'll... just come out with is then. We're... not Amazon Prime members anymore.
"
22,9,Linda,"Then what are we?
"
22,9,Stephen," Everyone involved in the strike has been dropped down one level from Prime. We're... we're now Amazon USDA Choice.
"
22,9,Linda," That's... fine. We'll be USDA Choice. It's, it's almost as good as Prime.
"
22,9,Stephen," You're a good woman for saying that. But you're a bitch because it's a lie and you're patronizing me. 
"
22,9,Butters,"Mom, eh if I win the first prize in the bike parade, I'll give the money to you guys.
"
22,9,Stephen,"Please... I don't know what else to do. My family is all that matters to me.  I made a promise to provide for them. What if we never get what we're asking for from the strike?  What if they just get others to do all the boxing for us?
"
22,9,Bezos,"See how the worker begins to question his determination? Without his Amazon Prime Status, he fluctuates between being and non-being.
"
22,9,Stephen," My family has to come first.
"
22,9,Bezos,"Now... torn between memberships, the consumer-worker will reason that the strike is pointless. Prepare a bus. We must make sure that boxers who wish to box have a safe way into the fulfillment center.
"
22,9,Kyle,"I think maybe it was a bad idea to come here, you guys.
"
22,9,Mall Worker 2,"Why have you come to this place?
"
22,9,Stan,"We came because... we need... stuff.
"
22,9,Mall Worker 3," Do you seek cosmetics? 
"
22,9,Mall Worker 4," Do you need puppies? 
"
22,9,Mall Worker 5," Sample of lotion?
"
22,9,Stan,"What??
"
22,9,Mall Worker 5," Why, it's lemongrass lavender.
"
22,9,Stan,"No!  No, no, look. We need very specific stuff. There's a big bike parade on Saturday.
"
22,9,Cinnaroll employee,"Ohhh! Bike parade?
"
22,9,Hobby employee,"Bike parade?
"
22,9,Gamestop employee,"Ohh!
"
22,9,Wayne D,"Ohhh! Bike parade!
"
22,9,Build-A-Bear Workshop employee," That's nice!
"
22,9,Kyle,"Yeah. And the four of us are actually doing a group theme.
"
22,9,Cartman," The changing faces of immigrants in America as told through bicycles.
"
22,9,Mall Worker 6,"So... do you need... SHOES? 
"
22,9,Stan," Yeah. Uh, color-coded specific shoes in four specific sizes.
"
22,9,Mall Workers,"Aww!
"
22,9,Stan,"What?
"
22,9,Mall Worker 1," We do not have the inventory that online wholesalers can provide. 
"
22,9,Cartman,"This is a waste of time, you guys.
"
22,9,Kenny,"(Yeah. Shit, let's get the fuck out of here.)
"
22,9,Mall Worker 7," Please! You are the only customers we've had the pleasure of assisting since the fulfillment center opened.
"
22,9,Stan,"H-Hold on a minute. You all stay here 'cause you want to work?
"
22,9,Mall Worker 6,"It is... our purpose.
"
22,9,Mall Workers,"Our purpose.
"
22,9,Mall Worker 4,"Our purpose.
"
22,9,Stan,"Wait a minute. You guys... I think I have an idea.
"
22,9,Tom," A bus with employees wishing to return to work is about to arrive here at the fulfillment center, and the strikers are not happy. Also, dozens of Amazon customers have shown up.  Angry customers who wish to be fulfilled.
"
22,9,Customers,"We want our stuff! We want our stuff!
"
22,9,Tom,"The customers say the boxers need to return to work because the shutdown is hurting everyone. 
"
22,9,Randy,"I have a weed business to run! I need my shit from Amazon to make it all work!
"
22,9,Josh,"At what cost, sir?! Do you care that personal worth is being reduced by capitalists to exchange value?!
"
22,9,Randy,"Oh yeah, that's typical rhetoric from a Marxist box.
"
22,9,Josh,"Free trade is not free-dom! Perhaps socialism IS the answer!
"
22,9,Tom,"If you pay for shipping, can you go anywhere you want?
"
22,9,Stuart," Here comes the bus!
"
22,9,Strikers," Scabs! Scabs! Scabs! Scabs! Scabs! Scabs! Scabs! Scabs! Scabs! Scabs! Scabs! Scabs!
"
22,9,Stuart,"Hey, it's Stotch! 
"
22,9,Gruff Worker,"Ya can't do it, Stotch! Ya damned us all!
"
22,9,Stephen," Don't you understand? It's not about me! It's my son!
"
22,9,Gruff Worker,"If those orders get fulfilled, then we got nothin'!
"
22,9,Stephen,"He's just a kid! He wants to be in the bike parade!
"
22,9,Gruff Worker,"My son's in the bike parade too!  He's got... little tassels off the back of his seat. Tiny flags stickin' out the handlebars. But he deserves more, Stotch! If we don't make our stand now, he doesn't have a chance. He'll get fookin' third or fourth place or just a fookin' participation ribbon!
"
22,9,Stephen," I'm sorry. 
"
22,9,Gruff Worker,"Stotch!
"
22,9,Bezos,"It is... not as I expected. Only one consumer worker broke through the picket lines. Your townspeople are more stubborn than I thought.
"
22,9,Mayor,"They're... prideful people, yes.
"
22,9,Bezos,"Perhaps I should give up. How I long to return to Bezos and touch butts with my wife.  Amazon Fulfillment Center.
"
22,9,Stan,"Uh yeah, hi. We ordered a bunch of stuff and we haven't gotten it.
"
22,9,Bezos," Yes, yes, the workers are striking. We're fucking working on it!
"
22,9,Stan,"No, that's actually why we're calling. We know a whole bunch of people who can come work for you.
"
22,9,Bezos," Is that so? Now those fools will pay! 
"
22,9,Stan,"What fools will pay?
"
22,9,Bezos,"Uh no, sorry, um... you say you have worker-consumers? willing to box?
"
22,9,Stan,"Yeah, but listen: we want our stuff! We ordered a bunch of shit for the bike parade, and if we get you workers, we want them to deliver our stuff first!
"
22,9,Bezos,"Very well. Stay right where you are.  You didn't tell me there was a bike parade.
"
22,9,Mayor,"I didn't think it was relevant.
"
22,9,Bezos,"Everything is relevant when it comes to customers. 
"
22,9,Josh,"The history of this world...
"
22,9,Josh,"is the history of class struggles.
"
22,9,Josh,"Alienated from the products of their labor...
"
22,9,Josh,"from their fellow laborers and from their very essence.
"
22,9,Josh,"The oppressed worker will eventually strike back at those capitalists who control the means of production.
"
22,9,Josh,"We have nothing to lose but our chains.
"
22,9,Josh,"We will unite in revolution.
"
22,9,Gruff Worker,"And if others try to break through the picket line?
"
22,9,Josh," Nothing else can be allowed into the fulfillment center, no matter what the cost.
"
22,9,Skeeter,"We're ready to follow you, Josh.
"
22,9,Josh,"Then follow me to Hell.
"
22,10,Kyle,"Yehehes! Yeessss!
"
22,10,Gerald," What is it, Kyle?
"
22,10,Kyle,"I got fulfilled! It's all the stuff I ordered for the bike parade.  Yeah?
"
22,10,Cartman,"Kyle, did you get your stuff?! I got my stuff! Yeah, dude!  Stan and Kenny got their stuff too! Bring it all over to my house! We gotta get ready for the bike parade!
"
22,10,Gerald,"Hey, were my boxes there too?
"
22,10,Kyle,"No, Dad. These were special deliveries from Jeff Bezos. We helped Amazon with their strike, and he had our orders shipped.
"
22,10,Gerald,"Jeff Bezos? The founder and CEO of Amazon?
"
22,10,Kyle," Yeah. We helped him find workers to work during the strike.
"
22,10,Kyle,"So he found our orders and had them sent to us.
"
22,10,Gerald,"Well, can he find my packages too? 
"
22,10,Woman 1,"No, I know. They said the workers are still on strike. They don't know when our orders- 
"
22,10,Man 1,"Alexa, can I have my stuff shipped from a different ful-? 
"
22,10,Man 2,"No, that's a bad dog, Banjo! Bad dog! 
"
22,10,Woman 2," Oh, yes. Oh, oh, o- 
"
22,10,Stuart,"Jeff Bezos?!  Are you freakin' kiddin' me?! Why is Jeff Bezos sending you packages?
"
22,10,Stuart,"Do you even care there's a strike going on?!
"
22,10,Kenny,"(No, Dad. These are all for the bike parade.)
"
22,10,Stuart,"Bike parade?! You dad is part of the strike, you little shit!  This whole town is suffering because of Amazon and you're out worrying about a bike parade! 
"
22,10,Randy,"I can't even believe you would say that, Sharon!
"
22,10,Sharon,"Randy, it's time to face it. Your weed farm idea didn't work. You barely sell to two people a day.
"
22,10,Randy,"It's the stupid Amazon strike! I rely on things for marketing, Sharon! A small business needs products for exposure, and until those assholes go back to work, small businesses are gonna suffer! 
"
22,10,Man 3," Ex-excuse me. Could I buy some weed?
"
22,10,Randy," Aw yeah yeah, Of course.
"
22,10,Randy,"Out early today, huh? 
"
22,10,Man 3,"Yeah it's this stupid Amazon strike. None of my orders are getting fulfilled, and I just need something to take the edge off.
"
22,10,Randy,"Yeah, tell me about it.
"
22,10,Man 4," Hey, are you selling weed?
"
22,10,Randy,"Uh, yeah.
"
22,10,Man 4," My wife is going nuts not getting her packages. I told her I'd find her some kush.
"
22,10,Randy," Yeah, the Amazon strike really sucks. 
"
22,10,Driver," Hey man, we're about to go spend a day in the picket line. Can you sell us some weed?
"
22,10,Randy,"You're strikers?
"
22,10,Man 4," Well why don't you guys get back to work so we can get our packages?
"
22,10,Driver," Hey, fuck you buddy!
"
22,10,Randy,"Okay, okay, hold on. Uh, let me got some more weed.  Huh.
"
22,10,Tom," It's Day 5 of the Amazon Fulfillment Center strike.  Nothing has been resolved, and there is ever-mounting tension between the striking Amazon workers  and the people who want their stuff. 
"
22,10,Tom,"Josh Carter is an Amazon employee who suffered a horrific workplace accident. In order to drum up support for the strike, he's recently FedExed himself to Washington.  How are things going, Josh?
"
22,10,Josh,"They're going well, Tom. Thank you. You know, what happened to me could happen to any worker at a fulfillment center. I'm speaking to Congress here and then heading back to Colorado tomorrow via UPS.
"
22,10,Tom,"Meanwhile, Amazon says it's training new workers to replace the strikers. However, because the workers previously worked at a mall, they've had no human contact for quite some time.
"
22,10,Stephen,"Welcome to the fulfillment center. I'm your floor manager, Stephen Stotch.  Being a fulfilled isn't hard. Uh, you just follow a few basic steps.  You start by getting an order on your fulfillment device.  Uh, it's order 6503. Mrs. Sandy Milner wants a Luminart coffee grinder. So you send that order to the first available transaction robot.  Okay, the robot will locate the grinder and bring it to the packing area.  Now, put the coffee grinder in the box to fulfill the order.  Go on. Put it in. 
"
22,10,Mall Worker 8,"This isn't very fulfilling.
"
22,10,Stephen,"Sure it is. You just gotta get into it, okay? That's one order down, we have  12,400 more to go. 
"
22,10,Randy," All right, there you go, friend. That's an ounce of weed, and thanks for supportin' small business. Next?
"
22,10,Man 5,"Hey, could you sell me more than an ounce?
"
22,10,Randy,"Sorry friend, that's the law. Us simple farmin' folk respect the law and each other.
"
22,10,Man 5,"No, it's fine. I'll just go over to the Anderson Weed Farm and buy more there.
"
22,10,Randy," Well don't buy weed from them. Their weed sucks.
"
22,10,Man 5,"It's a long way to drive out here. Need to make it worth my while. 
"
22,10,Randy,"Shit! This whole Amazon strike has more people smoking weed than ever. We have to make sure Tegridy Weed stays ahead of the competition!
"
22,10,Towelie," We need to find a way to get the weed to the people.
"
22,10,Randy,"Yeah, like a, like a delivery service. Some way so people don't have to drive out here and even see the other weed farms!
"
22,10,Towelie,"You know what they got? They got these e-scooters nowadays.
"
22,10,Randy,"You mean the things that almost killed us all on Halloween? Yeah, I 'member. 
"
22,10,Towelie,"What if we use e-scooters to get the weed directly to the customers?
"
22,10,Randy,"Oh shit. We could have Tegridy all over town.
"
22,10,Stephen,"What the--?
"
22,10,Linda,"Stephen! Stephen! It's a miracle! 
"
22,10,Stephen,"I don't understand.
"
22,10,Butters," Look Dad, a whole new bicycle! I'll win the bike parade for sure!
"
22,10,Linda,"You must have gotten our Prime membership back!
"
22,10,Stephen,"I guess I did. The bigwigs promoted me to manager. I'm been training new employees. 
"
22,10,Stephen,"When did all this stuff arrive?
"
22,10,Linda,"It just came a few hours ago.  Oh Stephen, you did it!
"
22,10,Bezos,"Your townspeople are beginning to learn that cooperation is rewarded by fulfillment. Now there's only one true enemy who stands in our way. Tonight he's giving a talk on Marxist theory.
"
22,10,Josh,"How is the common worker kept submissive? By the institutions and the ideology of the bourgeoisie. We only ask for compassion, for a fair share of the fruits of our labors. 
"
22,10,Larry,"Yeah, it's this Saturday. Everyone's gonna watch. You girls should come check it out. Yeah, it's gonna be a pretty nice bike parade, I suppose.
"
22,10,Butters," Hey, Larry.  You gettin' excited for the bike parade?  Yeah, I guess I'm lookin' forward to it. 
"
22,10,Girl,"Wow.
"
22,10,Butters,"I guess my bike could be in the bike parade. I... I hadn't really thought about it.
"
22,10,Larry,"Uh, y-you girls check out the flag on the back of my bike? They, they're silk.
"
22,10,Butters,"Oh yeah.  I'll see you there, Larry. Later, girls. 
"
22,10,Sally," Hmph!
"
22,10,Butters," Yippie! 
"
22,10,Ryan,"Amazon Boxes?! 
"
22,10,Sarah," It might be!
"
22,10,Ryan," Yes!  Oh.
"
22,10,Towelie,"Hello, sir. I have your weed delivery.
"
22,10,Ryan,"My what?
"
22,10,Sarah," Oh, that's mine.
"
22,10,Towelie,"There you are, ma'am.  Enjoy your Tegridy.
"
22,10,Ryan,"You got a-? Are, are we splitting that?
"
22,10,Sarah,"Get your own. 
"
22,10,Ryan,"Do you have more?
"
22,10,Towelie,"We're here to please the customer! 
"
22,10,Stan,"Dude, we did it.
"
22,10,Kyle,"They look amazing.
"
22,10,Cartman,"There's no way we can't win, you guys. We are going to kill at the bike parade. We finally did it. We worked together, we overcame adversity, and everything is finally gonna be cool again.
"
22,10,Kyle," All right, Kenny's here.  Come on, dude. We're gonna take 'em for a test spin.
"
22,10,Kenny,"(Guys, listen to me. I'm not gonna do the bike parade.)
"
22,10,Stan,"You're not gonna do the bike parade?
"
22,10,Kyle,"Well why not?
"
22,10,Kenny,"(It's complicated. I talked to my father and he says it's all a bunch of commodity fetishism.)
"
22,10,Stan,"Commodity fetishism?
"
22,10,Kenny,"(Yes, it's stupid, but I'm out.) 
"
22,10,Kyle,"Kenny, you can't quit now! We have a four-bike theme!
"
22,10,Cartman,"Yeah, how do we do the changing face of immigrants in America without the Philippines?!
"
22,10,Kenny,"(I can't do it, guys! I quit.) 
"
22,10,Cartman," Kenny, no! You can't do this! We've worked so hard, and we've come so close! Oh my G- Oh my God! My anxiety! My anxiety is going off, you guys!
"
22,10,Stan,"Come on, Kenny, don't be a dick!
"
22,10,Kenny,"(You guys don't understand! My dad is one of the strikers!) 
"
22,10,Cartman," Oh my God! We did so much! We went through all this and he just quits?! That's it! That's it! I'm gonna shoot up the skewl!
"
22,10,Stan," Don't shoot up the school.
"
22,10,Cartman,"No, 'cause it's not fair! You work your ass off for nothing, and now my anxiety's back, and I'm gonna shoot up the skeewwwwl!
"
22,10,Burly Worker,"Here come the temp workers! Scabs!
"
22,10,Strikers,"Scabs! Scabs! Scabs! Scabs! Scabs! 
"
22,10,Stephen," Yeah, it's not always easy being a fulfiller, but I think, eventually, you'll find it's a rewarding job.
"
22,10,Gerald,"I don't really care. I just want my stuff. If I have to work at Amazon to get my packages, then so be it.
"
22,10,Stuart," Stotch! Hey Stotch! 
"
22,10,Stephen," What do you want, Stuart?
"
22,10,Stuart,"I just thought you'd want to know the kind of people you're sellin' out for.
"
22,10,Stephen,"What are you talking about?
"
22,10,Stuart,"It's Josh, man! He's gone missing! 
"
22,10,Stan,"How's it going?
"
22,10,Kyle,"How's it look like it's going? There's no way we're going to win this stupid bike parade!
"
22,10,Stan,"Our bikes aren't so bad.
"
22,10,Kyle," Face it Stan! Our bikes suck! We're gonna lose! We're gonna be the laughingstock of the whole thing!
"
22,10,Cartman,"Kyle's right.  I already bragged to everyone we were gonna beat them like bitches at the bike parade. We're gonna look like total douchebags. 
"
22,10,Stan,"I thought the four of us were unstoppable.
"
22,10,Cartman,"We are. It's just Kenny fucked us again.
"
22,10,Kyle,"I wish there never was a bike parade.
"
22,10,Cartman,"Yeah. Hey. What if there wasn't?
"
22,10,Stan,"What?
"
22,10,Cartman,"What if the bike parade got cancelled? We're never gonna win the bike parade, but if we get cancelled, then everybody loses.
"
22,10,Stan,"How do we get the bike parade cancelled?
"
22,10,Cartman,"How do you get anything cancelled? You bitch about it being insensitive!
"
22,10,Stan,"Hey, yeah. We can go to the Mayor and force her to cancel it.
"
22,10,Kyle,"What's offensive about a bike parade?
"
22,10,Cartman,"""What's offensive about a bike parade?"" Kyle, you small-minded piece of shit! We should cancel you just for saying that.
"
22,10,Kyle,"Oh, I get it.
"
22,10,Stan,"Yeah!
"
22,10,All four,"Yeah!
"
22,10,Cartman,"Everybody loses, you guys!
"
22,10,Bezos,"Do you know who I am?
"
22,10,Josh," Yeah. You're Jeff Bezos.
"
22,10,Bezos,"And you are Josh, former Amazon employee who suffered a workplace accident. You were wrongly packaged into a box, and now, if anyone tries to open it, your insides will burst apart. So you seek revenge.
"
22,10,Josh,"This isn't about revenge, Bezos. It's about the production of too many useful things resulting in too many useless people!
"
22,10,Bezos,"See how the box ridicules commercialism in order to try and feel better about itself.
"
22,10,Josh,"Damn you! You made everything nice and convenient, didn't you, Bezos?! But humans are more than consumers!
"
22,10,Bezos,"That's very eloquent... for a box--  A box that is the last thing standing in the way of real economic progress for this town.
"
22,10,Josh," What are you gonna do to me?
"
22,10,Bezos,"I'm not going to do anything to you. Alexa, go ahead. Sent them in.
"
22,10,Alexa,"Okay. 
"
22,10,Bezos,"Hello, children. Uncle Jeff has a surprise for you! Who wants a special present for the bike parade?!
"
22,10,Kids,"Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me!...
"
22,10,Josh,"Oh my God...
"
22,10,Bezos,"Whoever opens the box gets what's inside! 
"
22,10,Josh," No! No, don't give in to your consumerism, kids!  NO! 
"
22,10,Boy,"It's mine! It's mine! I got it! I get it! 
"
22,10,Bezos,"Heheh. 
"
22,10,Larry,"Every year, I win the bike parade. It's the one thing I care about. Now there's kids out there who have better bikes than me because you won't get off your ass and work, Dad!
"
22,10,Mr. Zewiski," Larry, I want to! But I'd be a no-good traitor! Can't you understand?! 
"
22,10,Larry,"All I understand is that you suck! 
"
22,10,Mrs. Zewiski,"Where are you going?
"
22,10,Mr. Zewiski,"Son's right. Picket line or not, I'm gonna cross it, right now! 
"
22,10,Towelie,"Hello, sir. I have your weed delivery.
"
22,10,Mr. Zewiski,"Oh, my weed. Forgot I ordered that.
"
22,10,Randy," Oh hey, listen! We have an app now! You can keep track of your orders and get your Tegridy delivered even faster.  Oop. There's an order now. 
"
22,10,Stan,"First thing we've gotta do to get the bike parade cancelled is raise awareness.
"
22,10,Cartman,"Yeah. We're gonna need poster boards, markers, and lots of glitter and glue.
"
22,10,Kyle,"I can't believe Kenny bailed on us just because he thinks Jeff Bezos is a bad guy.
"
22,10,Cartman,"Yeah, how can somebody who gives you whatever you want be a bad guy?  It's locked. 
"
22,10,Richard," They're closed. We're all closed. Our coffee shop -- everything.
"
22,10,Cartman,"But we're outraged about something. We need glitter and glue.
"
22,10,Richard,"Yeah. Well, when the Amazon Fulfillment Center opened, everything else went out of business.
"
22,10,Mayor," I let it happen.  I thought the fulfillment center would be nothing but great for the town. Instead it's... it's buried us.
"
22,10,Man 5,"But it's Christmas. It's Christmas and we've no presents, no decorations. And there's no one who can help us. 
"
22,10,Man 6," Look!
"
22,10,Santa," Ho ho ho ho!
"
22,10,Man 7,"It's Santa! 
"
22,10,Woman 3,"It's a miracle!
"
22,10,Santa," I heard some people here might need a little Christmas magic.
"
22,10,Stan,"We sure do, Santa!
"
22,10,Man 8,"It's only a couple of weeks until Christmas, and we don't have any presents!
"
22,10,Santa,"Well, that's no problem for the hometown of my favorite holiday poo! Where is Mr. Hankey?  Where is that old bundle of Christmas cheer? 
"
22,10,Mayor,"We... We had to get rid of Mr. Hankey.
"
22,10,Santa,"Got rid of him?
"
22,10,Mackey,"Uh, Mr. Hankey did somethin' bad, and we were forced to make him uh... leave. Forever.
"
22,10,Santa,"Jesus, what did he do? Fuck a kid?
"
22,10,Mayor,"No. He um.. he tweeted some uh... inappropriate things.
"
22,10,Santa," ""He tweeted some inappropriate things?""  Oh, you bunch of fuckin'- I'm getting back in my sleigh now. 
"
22,10,Stan,"Nononono! Wait wait wait, please!
"
22,10,Santa,"Merry Christmas! Have fun sucking Jeff Bezos' dick, you bunch of cunts! 
"
22,10,Singer,"Christ, the savior, is born...
"
22,10,DJ,"Continuing with non-stop holiday music. Here's a song from that hot new group, The PC Babies. It's a song about how the idea of Mrs. Claus perpetuates female stereotypes. It's called, ""Jingle All The Waahhhh."" 
"
22,10,Butters," Hey Dad? I don't need anything more. I mean, if I don't win that bike parade, I don't care. I have you guys, and... that's more important than a bike parade will ever be.
"
22,10,Stephen,"No it isn't, Butters. I want to quit working for Amazon. I want to quit working for Amazon. I want to join my friends in striking but... I know that you have to have your stuff to be happy.
"
22,10,Butters,"No I don't Dad.
"
22,10,Stephen," You need your Amazon Prime shows and your music and your books. and your things delivered to your door like little presents to yourself that make you feel satisfied. I can live without those things, but you... can't.  That's why I'm gonna continue working at Amazon. For you! 
"
22,10,Towelie," Hello, sir. I'm with the Tegridy Weed Company. We're just makin' sure folks are aware of our new rewards program.
"
22,10,Stephen,"What?
"
22,10,Towelie,"We now have three levels of membership for our weed. There's Tegridy, Tegridy Plus, and Tegridy Elite. But you don't want to be elite, 'cause elite's got no Tegridy. 
"
22,10,Cartman,"It's just such bullcrap, you guys.
"
22,10,Kyle,"Such bullcrap.
"
22,10,Cartman,"How come everything out there is getting cancelled, but when it comes to us, we just can't do it?
"
22,10,Stan,"I mean, are we supposed to just keep going? Just go on, making total asses of ourselves?
"
22,10,Kyle," No. No! The problem is that when it comes to outrage, your average person actually doesn't give a shit, unless it has something to do with them.
"
22,10,Cartman," That's right. we've been selfish. We can't get the parade cancelled for us. We have to do it for all the other people who want it cancelled, but their voices aren't being heard!
"
22,10,Stan," Yeah! What? Did we think this was a fucking joke? The bike parade is offensive, and the government thinks they can just force it on everyone!
"
22,10,Cartman,"Come on! I'm actually pissed off now! 
"
22,10,Stan,"Mayor, we demand you cancel this bike parade!
"
22,10,Cartman,"It is nihilistic and out of touch with progressive thinking! 
"
22,10,Bezos,"What's the matter? Afraid you wouldn't win?
"
22,10,Stan,"It's him.
"
22,10,Bezos,"The bike parade was quite useful to me. You see, people will do anything to have fulfillment. They finally realized the only way to get it would be to all work for the fulfillment center.
"
22,10,Cartman,"Who would use the bike parade like some $20 hooker?
"
22,10,Kyle,"Kenny was right about you. You're a bad guy!
"
22,10,Bezos,"Oh, you mean your little socialist friend? Yes, he's starting to rattle his sword now, too. Alexa, kill Kenny.
"
22,10,Alexa,"Okay. I'll kill Kenny for you.
"
22,10,Stan," No!
"
22,10,Kyle,"Why are you doing this?!
"
22,10,Bezos," Don't you see I'm trying to help? Before, there was war between classes, customers and workers at odds. All I've done is create the new class: the consumer-worker. The future. Right now your parents, your teachers, everyone you know are showing up to work at the fulfillment center, and I'm afraid you are all going to lose the bike parade.
"
22,10,Randy," Bezos! Bezos!
"
22,10,Crowd," Bezos! Bezos! Bezos! 
"
22,10,Randy,"Hello Bezos! You can take your fulfillment center and fulfill it right up your ass! See, there's one thing you didn't count on, and that's Tegridy! Just look in the eyes of these people!  Everyone has Tegridy now! Tegridy that you will never understand! We aren't just different classes of people anymore, we are a town!
"
22,10,Bezos," Are you all high?
"
22,10,Crowd," No, no...
"
22,10,Randy,"Why do you ask that?
"
22,10,Bezos,"Because I'm over here!
"
22,10,Randy,"Oh. Hang on.  Hold on. Okay, I got it. Anyways... you see, Tegridy is something that can't be understood by big corporations! Oh, they'll try to package Tegridy, but only I can really package Tegridy. I got more money now 'cause of Tegridy, and that's 'cause I figured out how to get Tegridy to everyone. And that's- now everyone is in their state of Tegridy that's impenetrable. Am I making sense?
"
22,10,Bezos,"NO!
"
22,10,Randy,"The point is, nobody's comin' to work for you! So you can take your whole plan and fulfill it somewhere else! 
"
22,10,Bezos," Damn you, Tegridy! 
"
22,10,Singers,"
Ice-cold beer, down-home days
country music and bike parades
We got Tegridy all around (round, round)
That's life livin' in our Colorado town. 


"
22,10,Stan,"I guess they are offensive. 
"
22,10,Singers,"
We don't need nothing from big corporations
We don't need progress or fancy educations
Maybe our tegridy keepw us down (down, down)
But that's life livin' in our Colorado town.


"
22,10,Butters,"Hey, Mom. Hi Dad.
"
22,10,Stephen," Sure are, Butters.
"
22,10,Singers,"
Now we gotta learn to live without boxes every day
We might wake up tomorrow and wonder why they went away 
Guess you might call us a bunch of white trash hicks (hicks, hicks) 
But at least we ain't suckin' no Bezosian dicks.


"
22,10,Announcer,"Tegridy Weed. Comin' soon to a giant online retailer near you.
