20,1,Jim,"Hello everyone and welcome back. We are live at South Park Elementary School where the local girl's volleyball team is about to take on the Jefferson Sabers.
"
20,1,Mike,"And, hey Jim, it is packed. Sellout crowds tonight, first time in team history. Everyone turning out to see what's going to happen.
"
20,1,Jim," That's right, Mike. All eyes are of course on fourth grader Nichole Daniels. Will she sit or stand for the National Anthem? 
"
20,1,Mike,"This week with athletes all over the country sitting down for the National Anthem,  the question on everyone's mind is ""What is this little girl gonna do?""
"
20,1,Jimbo,"She's not gonna sit down. Why would she?
"
20,1,Randy,"Screw that. I've got 100 bucks riding on this. Come on, Nichole. Sit on it!
"
20,1,Sports Commentator,"Now please rise for the National Anthem. 
"
20,1,Randy,"This is it.
"
20,1,Mike,"The National Anthem starts. Nichole Daniels seems to be waiting. So far no si... Oh!  And Heidi Turner is sitting down!
"
20,1,Crowd,"Ooh!
"
20,1,Jim,"Might be totally unexpected. All eyes were on Nichole when Heidi Turner comes out of nowhere and sits down.
"
20,1,Mike," And there goes Meghan Ridley! The crowd is going wild. What a turn of events! Let's check in with Dave.
"
20,1,Dave,"And Mike, I've just looked at the girl's Twitter accounts and it appears they are sitting out the National Anthem to protest the harassment and trolling they receive on the Internet.
"
20,1,Mike,"Complete surprise, Dave. Nobody saw this coming. Three girls now sitting down and finally, there goes Nichole.
"
20,1,Randy,"Wow, Yeah, 100 bucks!
"
20,1,Jim,"And, as the anthem draws to a close, this thing is over.
"
20,1,Mike,"The final result, four athletes sitting out of the National Anthem, three of them not even black. A shocker here in South Park, thanks for joining us. 
"
20,1,Stephen,"Oh my god, that was great. 
"
20,1,Referee,"Ah, play ball. 
"
20,1,PC Principal,"Alright, ladies. First of all I wanna say that I completely respect your decision to protest our national anthem. Thought it was sweet. I believe you shed some light on some very important issues regarding gender equality.
"
20,1,Heidi,"What are you doing about Eric Cartman?!
"
20,1,PC Principal,"Ladies, I understand you're upset about the trolling you've received on the Internet, but there is no evidence that Eric Cartman is Skankhunt42.
"
20,1,Wendy,"It is him, it's completely obvious, and nobody is doing anything about it!
"
20,1,PC Principal,"Well he claims that he's been working at changing himself and the world around him.  Send in Mr. Cartman.
"
20,1,Cartman," You wanted to see me, PC Principal?
"
20,1,PC Principal,"Mr. Cartman, I'm gonna ask you one more time, are you or are you not the Internet troll Skankhunt42?
"
20,1,Cartman,"It's ""Skankhunt42"" and no I am not.
"
20,1,Heidi,"He's lying. Make him show you his phone.
"
20,1,Cartman,"Unfortunately, that'd be a breach of my civil rights, but I can assure you, nobody respected you girls' poignant protest more than I did.
"
20,1,Joe Biden,"Fellow Senators, our nation is divided like never before. While people everywhere fight for their voices to be heard, perhaps it is time for us to consider that our national anthem needs to be changed. Americans need an anthem that inspires and excites, an anthem that has something for everyone while still paying tribute to what it once was. I believe there's only one person capable of achieving this.  J.J. Abrams.
"
20,1,Senators," J.J. Abrams!
"
20,1,Joe Biden,"He saved Star Wars, and now we will ask him to save our country.
"
20,1,Lady Senator," Mr. Abrams? Mr. Abrams, we need to speak with you.
"
20,1,Male Senator,"Look, there. 
"
20,1,Lady Senator," Mr. Abrams I speak on behalf of Americans everywhere. We've come to ask you to reboot the national anthem. Please Mr. Abrams. We know you've been asked to reboot a lot.
"
20,1,Senator 2," We know you're tired.
"
20,1,Lady Senator,"We know you're tired.
"
20,1,Senator 3," What do you say, sir? We all want something new and that makes us remember the things we lost. We want to 'member! We need your 'member berries! 
"
20,1,Male Senator,"One light means yes, two lights means no. 
"
20,1,Cartman,"Fellow students, as you know, an Internet troll by the name of Skankhunt42 has been harassing women and girls by making degrading comments on our school message board. The girls are very upset, and many male students believe that it's just because girls don't have a sense of humor. I beg to disagree. Girls rule, women are funny, get over it. Just the other day, in the hallway, I heard two male students saying how the new Ghostbusters sucked balls. I was shocked and appalled. It is time for us all to realize and accept that girls are cool, and women are funny. Wendy? Wendy, could you come up here, please? Come on up, Wendy. Wendy Testaburger, guys.  Wendy, go ahead. Be funny.  Say something funny, Wendy. We can't wait.
"
20,1,Wendy,"I'm not funny.
"
20,1,Cartman,"Hey, girls are funny, Wendy. Okay? Get over it. Just do women's comedy stuff. You know, talk about how fat you are and how you wanna have sex with guy and then say ""my vagina"" a lot..
"
20,1,Wendy,"I don't feel like being funny right now.
"
20,1,Cartman,"And that's just the kind of sexist bull-crap that's gonna keep you in the kitchen. Sit your ass down.  This isn't a joke, you guys. Girls are funny. Bebe, why don't you come up here? Come on, Bebe.
"
20,1,Bebe,"NO!
"
20,1,Cartman,"No? Come on, talk about havin' sex with guys, and say ""vagina"" and stuff like that. Go ahead.  Girls rule, women are funny. Bebe, get over yourself. Seriously.
"
20,1,Bebe,"Get the mic out of my face!
"
20,1,Cartman," Huh. Oh my God, that wasn't really all that funny. That's weird. Um, let's see. Red? You have any zingers for the crowd? No? How about you, Nelly?
"
20,1,Nelly,"Yeah, I got one. You're a fat fuck! 
"
20,1,Cartman,"K, that wasn't really funny, it was just angry.
"
20,1,Nelly," You see, what the problem is, is that when a little troll is allowed to say anything he wants anonymously, then he speaks for all you boys!
"
20,1,Cartman,"K, that's good, now just try to say it a little funnier now.
"
20,1,Nelly,"Go ahead and get on our school message board and see what he's saying about us! Then see if you guys think it's funny!
"
20,1,Cartman,"Okay, and then, and then, and then just go, ""my vagina.""
"
20,1,News anchor 1,"And as our country seems to be more and more divided, the only hope is that J.J. Abrams' new national anthem will appeal to everyone and bring back those nostalgic member berries we know and love.
"
20,1,Randy,"Oh great. Everything's getting a reboot now. 
"
20,1,Pollster,"Hello sir. I'm with the Gallup poll. We're trying to get a read on how people will be voting in the upcoming Presidential election?
"
20,1,Randy,"Oh. Oh-okay.
"
20,1,Pollster,"Great. And will you be voting for the giant douche or the turd sandwich?
"
20,1,Randy,"Well, this is usually a giant douche household but... we're going firmly with the turd sandwich.
"
20,1,Pollster,"Oh, the turd sandwich, huh?
"
20,1,Randy,"That's right.  You can put my wife and I both down for turd sandwich.
"
20,1,Pollster,"Well, good luck with that, heh. So far, giant douche is leading in the polls.
"
20,1,Randy," What?
"
20,1,Randy,"What the hell is wrong with people?! They really think that a giant douche should be President?? It's insane!
"
20,1,Sharon,"Why'd you say I'd be voting for the turd sandwich, Randy? You haven't even talked to me about it.
"
20,1,Randy,"You can't possibly be thinking about voting for the douche?!
"
20,1,Stan,"Hhhawgh!
"
20,1,Randy,"What's wrong with you?
"
20,1,Stan,"I just don't understand why every four years you people freak out over whether to vote for a giant douche or a turd sandwich.
"
20,1,Randy," Because we're Americans. 'Cause this is America
"
20,1,Stan,"Why are we doing this again? Why are we back to giant douche and turd sandwich?
"
20,1,Randy," Cyyynical. Cynical maaan. You just think everything and everyone is dumb, huh? 'Cause you're a kneel-ist.
"
20,1,Stan,"It's nihilist.
"
20,1,Randy,"See, you're such a nihilist.
"
20,1,News anchor 2,"Newest Gallup Poll results are in and they show Giant Douche to be leading Turd Sandwich by nearly 10%. Turd Sandwich has said there's no reason to panic.
"
20,1,Hillary Clinton (Turd Sandwich),"Polls are of course a useful tool, but they can often be misleading. Our campaign is holding strong.
"
20,1,Reporter 1," Mrs. Turd Sandwich?
"
20,1,Hillary,"Yes, Arthur?
"
20,1,Arthur,"Uh, Mrs. Sandwich, do you believe that your opponent will gain any momentum from this poll?
"
20,1,Hillary,"I'm sure that like me, Giant Douche realizes that polls are never the final answer.
"
20,1,Garrison,"Yeah! Suck that poll you dumb bitch! Up 10%. Can you believe that shit?!  Oh, Caitlyn. I think we're really gonna win this thing! Think about it.  In a couple of months I will be President of the United States.  Caitlyn, can I ask you somethin'? Uh, when we actually get into the White House, like um, what are we gonna do?
"
20,1,Caitlyn,"What do you mean?
"
20,1,Garrison,"Well I mean, like, you know, once we're President and Vice-President, like, what do we do then?
"
20,1,Caitlyn,"How the fuck should I know?
"
20,1,Garrison," Cait, you, you heard about the poll, right? We're probably gonna win. Don't tell me you don't have a plan.
"
20,1,Caitlyn,"What plan? I thought you had a plan.
"
20,1,Garrison,"I don't have any fuckin' plan! That's why I have you! I'm gonna be the President and you're gonna be in charge of all foreign and domestic policies!
"
20,1,Caityln,"I thought you were gonna do that part.
"
20,1,Garrison,"Are you tellin' me that we're about to be voted into office and we have no idea what the fuck we're gonna do??  Ohhh Jeeez!
"
20,1,Kyle,"I think they called it German Collective Guilt, right? Where even the Germans who just did nothing while Hitler rose to power were, were maybe somehow also responsible?
"
20,1,Mr. Mackey,"Uh huh, uh, m'kay, okay.
"
20,1,Kyle,"But I can't control what Cartman does, so, so why should I feel ashamed for what Cartman does?
"
20,1,Mr. Mackey,"Well J.J. Abrams was just rebooting the National Anthem, Kyle, so everything's gonna be fine, m'kay?
"
20,1,Kyle,"I don't think the answer to all this is member berries.
"
20,1,Mr. Mackey,"You don't like mem- member berries?
"
20,1,Kyle,"Agh, never mind. I'm just gonna stay out of it. 
"
20,1,Berries,"Oh I 'member. 'Member Chewbacca? Yeah. And 'member AT-ATs? Member? Ey! Hey, 'member Ghostbusters? Ohh, I 'member. 'Member Slimer? Oh, I loved Slimer. 'Member? Ohh, I 'member. 
"
20,1,Mr. Mackey,"How could someone think these things are bad? 
"
20,1,Announcer,"The Commander in Chief Forum, with a giant douche and a turd sandwich.
"
20,1,Moderator,"Back now with the Commander in Chief Forum. I am joined by the Republican nominee, a giant douche.
"
20,1,Garrison,"Thanks, Matt.
"
20,1,Matt,"Mr. Douche, some say you don't actually have a viable plan in place if you were to be elected President.
"
20,1,Garrison,"Huh! Huh well, well who said that? The turd sandwich?
"
20,1,Matt,"In your campaign, you said that you will deal with our country's immigrants and enemies by personally  fucking them all to death. How do you plan to actually achieve that?
"
20,1,Garrison,"Well, Matt, I don't think I said I would fuck them all to death.
"
20,1,Matt,"Okay, well, let's roll the tape on that.
"
20,1,Garrison,"Oh, sure, okay.  Well there's only one immigration policy that I believe in, and that's ""fuck them all to death!""  Fuck them all to death! Let's make this country great again!
"
20,1,Crowd,"Fuck them all to death!
"
20,1,Garrison," And then I'm gonna take all the drug pushers in our country, and I'm gonna fuck them-!  And you know those people in Syria, I'm gonna fuck them!  That's how we'll make sure that every terrorist on earth is fuckin' dead!  The leaders of North Korea? I'll fuck them all, yeah!  Yeah! Yeah!  The criminals in our jails?! Fuckin' dead a day after I-  Yeah! Those ads that are tryin' to kill us? I'll fuck anyone in the advertising business! And they'll all die too!
"
20,1,Matt,"So by our estimates, it's roughly 7.6 million people you have promised to fuck to death in your first year of office.
"
20,1,Garrison,"Uh huh, okay.
"
20,1,Matt,"And, and, you think that's achievable?
"
20,1,Garrison,"I do. I do, Matt. Uh, I mean, I'm not gonna just get elected, you know, and, and look like a jackass. Huh, huhuh.  Ohhh Jeeez.
"
20,1,Teacher,"Alright kids, today we have a very special treat. One of the older students has written an original children's story and is gonna read it to you. Come on over, Eric.
"
20,1,Cartman," Hi guys!  Are you all ready to hear a story?
"
20,1,Preschoolers,"Yeah!
"
20,1,Cartman,"This was a book I created all with my imagination. It's called ""Little Red Riding Kyle. The story of a little gay boy and his adventure with four hilarious women. One day, Little Red Riding Kyle was walking through the forest thinking about guys. He was on his way to visit his grandma, who was a little black boy named Tolkien."" Get over it. ""But then, a big bad wolf who was a hilarious woman named Janet walked into the house and said 'I have a large vagina' and traded place-"" 
"
20,1,Kyle,"What the hell are you doing?!
"
20,1,Cartman,"Rebooting fairy tales to try and ease the friction caused by Internet trolls.
"
20,1,Kyle,"You really think you're fooling anyone with this fake persona?! Everyone knows you're acting this way by day so you can be horrible to people on the Internet at night!
"
20,1,Cartman,"Why would I do that, Kyle?
"
20,1,Kyle,"I don't really care! Just don't drag me into it! 
"
20,1,Randy,"What is wrong with people, huh?! How can they vote against a turd sandwich more than a giant douche?! It's senseless!
"
20,1,Stephen,"Randy, you gotta calm down.
"
20,1,Randy," How can anyone be calm at a time like this?!  People actually think a turd is worse than a douche!
"
20,1,Stephen,"Look, maybe you need some supplements to help calm your nerves. Have you heard of member berries?
"
20,1,Randy,"Member berries?
"
20,1,Stephen,"It's a new superfruit that helps you mellow out and relax.
"
20,1,Berries,"'Member The Fugitive? 'Member Bambi? 'Member Alien Nation? Yeah, I 'member...
"
20,1,Stephen,"The guys at work told me about them. Been taking them about six months now. I'll telling you, they really take the edge off.
"
20,1,Berries,"'Member Explorers? The little kids in a spaceship? 'Member storm troopers? 'Member?
"
20,1,Randy,"Oh, they're adorable. 
"
20,1,Garrison,"Come on, people! I need answers! Real solutions! You're my advisers, for Christ's sake! How do we do this?!
"
20,1,Adviser 1,"Maybe, if you swam in a pool in Florida, you could contract the Zika virus. Then you fuck all the people you can, and hope they eventually die.
"
20,1,Garrison,"That would take way too long! And there's no guarantee every pool in Florida has Zika!
"
20,1,Adviser 2,"Could you use nuclear weapons? Then fuck all the bodies after the fact?
"
20,1,Garrison," Ugh! What the hell do I do? If I win I won't be able to do what I promised. But every day I keep going up in the polls. Why did the Democrats have to elect such a turd sandwich?
"
20,1,Caitlyn,"Maybe you should just quit.
"
20,1,Garrison,"If I quit, I look like a total jackass.  If I win the election, I look like a total jackass. I have to keep running,  but I have to make sure she wins.
"
20,1,Butters,"Haha! You guys see what Skankhunt42 did on the school server now? Hehe, he photo shopped a picture of Heidi Turner's mom with a dick in her mouth!
"
20,1,Craig,"I wanna see.
"
20,1,Butters," Look! There's Wendy's mom with a dick in her mouth too! 
"
20,1,Kyle,"Goddammit!  Do you guys even care how this makes the girls feel?!
"
20,1,Craig,"We didn't do it.
"
20,1,Kyle,"We all know who did! And if we don't do something, then the girls will eventually retaliate against us!
"
20,1,Cartman," Help!  Help me! Augh! Aw! 
"
20,1,Butters,"Eric! What happened!
"
20,1,Cartman,"A bunch of girls! They cornered me in the gym! They said all boys needed to pay! They kicked and they hit me and, and they kept me down and drew this vagina on my face!  They said it was to send a message!
"
20,1,Clyde,"That's a vagina?
"
20,1,Cartman,"Yeah. See, here's the top of the vagina and there's the balls.   It's starting, you guys! None of us is safe anymore!
"
20,1,Kyle," I didn't know vagina had balls.
"
20,1,Cartman,"Yeah, no, they do! Vaginas totally have balls! Right?
"
20,1,Kyle,"You're just trying to start a war, aren't you?!
"
20,1,Cartman,"What do you mean? If vaginas don't have balls, what do they have?
"
20,1,Kyle,"It's not gonna work, Cartman! I'm not gonna let you divide boys and girls in this school anymore! when this whole thing comes to an end, you're gonna be all on your own! 
"
20,1,Garrison,"Hello sir, how are you today? I'm calling from the Campaign for President, just seeing if uh, I can get your support for Hillary Clinton today. Yes, I know she's a turd sandwich, but you know if ya, if you look past that, you know she, she really has a lot to offer. Well, I hear you, but sometimes in life you just gotta suck a turd, you know? Hello?  Dammit! This is impossible! Are you having' any success, Caitlyn?!
"
20,1,Caitlyn,"I've tried to get people on board, but she's just such a turd sandwich. You're just gonna have to do something awful to throw the election.
"
20,1,Garrison,"Every time I do something awful people just get more stoked on me! It's impossible to piss people off anymore!
"
20,1,Anchor 2,"This is breaking news. The moment has arrived. It is here. J.J. Abrams says he has finished the new National Anthem.
"
20,1,Garrison,"Turn it up.
"
20,1,Anchor 2,"The anthem is sure to be fresh and exciting while recapturing the moments we all knew and loved. Democratic nominee Turd Sandwich said she will be in attendance to show her support for the rebooted anthem.
"
20,1,Garrison,"Ohhh Jeeez.
"
20,1,Anchor 2,"Let's all hope that this new anthem puts our differences aside and unites this nation once again.
"
20,1,Garrison,"That's it, Cait. That's what I have to do. I'm gonna sit out the National Anthem on live television. Then everyone will have to vote for that turd sandwich!
"
20,1,Berries,"'Member Spock? Yeah. 'Member tricorders? I 'member. And 'member Bionic Man?
"
20,1,Randy,"Ohh, I 'member.
"
20,1,Berry,"Oh I loved Bionic Man 
"
20,1,Berries,"'Member the Millennium Falcon? 'member Chewbacca again? Oh I love to 'member Chewbacca. I 'member. 'Member? Hey hey hey! 'Member when there weren't so many Mexicans? Oh, I 'member.
"
20,1,Randy,"Wai- what?
"
20,1,Berries,"Yeah, yeah, yeah! 'Member when marriage was just between a man and a woman? I 'member! Oh, I 'member. Oh yeahhh.
"
20,1,Randy," Yeeah, I remember that.  Wait.
"
20,1,Berries,"'Member feeling safe? 'Member no ISIS? 'Member Reagan? Ohh, I 'member. Ooo, 'member? Ooo, 'member? 
"
20,1,Randy,"What the fuck's going on with these member berries?
"
20,1,Kyle,"Yeah?
"
20,1,Cartman," Hey broship. Got a minute?
"
20,1,Kyle,"What are you doing here??
"
20,1,Cartman,"You were right, Kyle. Okay? I drew the vagina on my face. I tried to fool people, but you keenly noticed my one tiny error in that girls don't have balls.
"
20,1,Kyle,"I'm going to the bathroom!
"
20,1,Cartman,"Kyle, you have to try and appreciate what I'm doing. I know that a war is coming between us and the girls. I knew it the moment they sat out the National Anthem.
"
20,1,Kyle," They sat it out because you were harassing them online.
"
20,1,Cartman,"Suppose for one second that I'm not Skankhunt42. And that I really have been doing what I've been doing to try and stop the damage he has done?
"
20,1,Kyle,"Why would you care?!
"
20,1,Cartman,"'Cause I'm scared, Kyle. I don't know if you've noticed, but race wars are back. And now if we get gender wars too??
"
20,1,Kyle,"If we could just prove who the troll was, then the girls wouldn't be wanting a war, would they?!
"
20,1,Cartman,"Yeah but... you can't track down an Internet troll,  it's too bad.
"
20,1,Kyle,"Just know this, Cartman! I'm going to prove who Skankhunt42 is, whatever it takes! Everyone is going to know! And Skankhunt is gonna pay for everything he's! ever! said!
"
20,1,Mike,"Hello everyone, we are live at tonight's game between the '49ers and the Panthers, but of course what everyone is really here for, the unveiling of the new National Anthem rebooted by J.J. Abrams.
"
20,1,Jim,"And Mike, this new anthem is said to have everything the old one had but, some new surprises as well. You'd have to be an absolute asshole not to stand and support it.
"
20,1,Mike,"This is such a big night for America that both Presidential candidates are here.  There you can see the Turd Sandwich waving to all four people excited by her.  And there's the Giant Douche doing the same.
"
20,1,Garrison,"When I sit down to not support this thing I'm sure to lose this election!
"
20,1,Announcer,"Ladies and Gentlemen-
"
20,1,Garrison,"Here it is!
"
20,1,Jim,"And the Anthem begins, let's hope this fixes America.
"
20,1,Announcer,"For our National Anthem we now ask you all in solidarity to please rise.  Or sit, or take a knee, in order to honor America. 
"
20,1,Garrison,"Wait a min- what, wait, what? Wait. 
"
20,1,Jim,"Ohhh! And J.J. Abrams has absolutely shattered expectations, Mike! Now whether people are standing, sitting, or kneeling, they are all honoring America. J.J. Abrams is a wizard, Tom. A wizard. 
"
20,1,Mike,"More people sitting now as Abrams has made it irrelevant. Who saw this coming?
"
20,1,Jim,"And there's the rest of the Anthem, all the parts we remembered and loved. J.J. Abrams has fixed America.
"
20,1,Garrison,"No, this was supposed to! Oh! OHHH JEEEZ!
"
20,1,Gerald," Hey Kyle.  You okay, son?
"
20,1,Kyle,"Yeah Dad. Just thinkin'.
"
20,1,Gerald,"Well um, I'll be in my office if you wanna talk. 
"
20,2,Dr. Wayne Schroeder,"Nobody is safe. Nobody can hide from these monsters. Internet trolls are truly predators of society. As parents we find it hard to believe our children are doing these things online, and that is why I've been asked to come and speak to you about the student who has been trolling your school message boards.
"
20,2,Dr. Schroeder,"This troll is known only as Skankhunt42. 
"
20,2,Dr. Schroeder,"We believe it probable he's one of the boy students here, since his favorite target seems to be women. Here, you can see Heidi Turner's mother photo shopped with a penis in her mouth, after she defended her daughter's right to sit out the national anthem.
"
20,2,Dr. Schroeder,"Since then, this child has been trolling all over the internet. Visiting message boards, and social media, and filling it with vile comments and hate-filled garbage. 
"
20,2,Dr. Schroeder,"But trolling is on the rise with teenagers, and we all need to come together to stop it. We need every parent to look for the signs in their own child.
"
20,2,Dr. Schroeder,"In order for us to find these secretive monsters, we need all parents to ask themselves: ""Could my child be a troll?"".
"
20,2,Sheila,"My God, what children are capable of now. What kind of hate would have to be in that child's heart?
"
20,2,Gerald,"Well, you never know, could be someone who just, kind of thinks it's funny to stir the pot and watch everyone freak out. 
"
20,2,Gerald,"Uh, you know! Maybe the fact that it's so not funny makes it somehow funny, to kids? Gosh, I-I certainly don't understand it.
"
20,2,Kyle,"Dude, what's going on?
"
20,2,Clyde,"You didn't hear?
"
20,2,Kyle,"Hear what? What happened?
"
20,2,Stan,"Heidi Turner. She... she quit Twitter.
"
20,2,Kyle,"Oh no. 
"
20,2,Stan,"Yesterday after school, she wrote one last tweet that said goodbye forever, and then just got off for good.
"
20,2,Kyle,"She'll get back on.
"
20,2,Stan,"No dude, she threw her phone in a river. She's... she's gone.
"
20,2,Mr. Mackey,"Alright students, I know we're all dealing with the loss of a good friend. We have to accept the fact that Heidi won't be on social media anymore. I know we're all gonna miss her, m'kay. We're gonna miss, seeing what she's up to; miss seeing her silly pictures she'd post of her and her friends, m'kay.
"
20,2,Mr. Mackey,"But this is what can happen when someone gets bullied online to the point they just can't go on anymore. 
"
20,2,Mr. Mackey,"I know that some of you are feeling anger, m'kay.  Some of you are feeling a little guilt, asking how something like this can happen. But the best thing we can do for Heidi, is come together as friends, and as students, m'kay.
"
20,2,Mr. Mackey,"So now, why don't we all get on Twitter, m'kay, and just tweet some of the, things we loved about Heidi, m'kay?
"
20,2,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay. Oh, that's nice, that's nice, m'kay. Oh, that's a good one Sarah, uh-huh. That-that's a - that's a pretty poem. Nice Butters. Oh, Heidi would have loved this so much. This is so special, m'kay.
"
20,2,Stan,"Okay. Can we all agree now,  that whoever is doing this, needs to stop?
"
20,2,Cartman,"Totally, you guys; this has gone far enough.  The girls are really pissed off at us. 
"
20,2,Stan,"So tonight, whoever is doing this, isn't going to do it again! 'Cause if he does, we're gonna have to do something about it!
"
20,2,Cartman,"You hear that guys? It'd better not happen again tonight!  I am so, seriously.
"
20,2,Gerald,"Ike? Can I talk to you?  Come on, pull up a chair.
"
20,2,Gerald,"You know, we had a big parent meeting at the school tonight, and uh, apparently, there's someone trolling the school message boards and, putting... penises in people's mouths. And whoever it was then got a big reaction from it, so he's now putting penises in people's mouths all over the internet. And... he's actually getting pretty famous!
"
20,2,Gerald,"Sooo, Annie Jerkin's mother started an online campaign to stop internet trolling with a picture of her and her daughter, and you know what happened? She got a dick in her mouth!
"
20,2,Gerald,"Ha-okay, okay, I know, it's just guy humor stuff, you know. We can laugh about about it here, but, it is serious too. Well, love you pal. Get to sleep, it's a school night. 
"
20,2,Gerald,"Oh, hey!
"
20,2,Sheila,"Did you talk to him?
"
20,2,Gerald,"Yeah, yeah, we talked. It was good.
"
20,2,Sheila,"Oh, that's good.
"
20,2,Gerald,"Yeah, well, I'd better go and get some of my work done.
"
20,2,Sheila,"Oh, right, right, yeah.
"
20,2,Gerald,"Yeah, don't wait up. I'll be a while with these stupid case profiles.
"
20,2,Sheila,"All right. Night Gerald.
"
20,2,Gerald,"Night sweetie. 
"
20,2,Woman 1,"Hey! Just wanna remind everyone about the ice cream social to benefit homeless teens. Looking for volunteers.
"
20,2,Gerald,"Hey, I'd like to volunteer to kick you in the vagina! Where do I sign up?!
"
20,2,Woman 2,"This is my daughter at the triathlon today! Go little girl!
"
20,2,Gerald,"Your daughter has a mustache - what the hell is wrong with your ovaries bitch?!
"
20,2,Commentator,"You've been dick-slapped!
"
20,2,Bebe,"You should've seen what he said about my mother on her Instagram! Pages and pages of disgusting things!
"
20,2,Annie,"This is an attack on all of us! It's time to make the boys suffer!
"
20,2,Wendy,"It has to be swift and serious. We have to make a statement. The girls in South Park aren't going to be treated like afterthoughts anymore!
"
20,2,Girls (except Heidi Turner),"Yeah!
"
20,2,Annie,"This has gone on too long and it's time to do something!
"
20,2,Girls (except Heidi Turner),"Yeah!
"
20,2,Clyde," What do you think they're talking about?
"
20,2,Butters,"They're talking about how they're gonna get us - what do you think? That's how the world works now. You get blamed for the group you belong to, even if you didn't do nothing!
"
20,2,Butters,"What are we gonna do about them?
"
20,2,Kyle,"The girls want to see Cartman punished so we have to prove it's him.
"
20,2,Craig,"We're never gonna prove that and you know it! We have to make him stop!
"
20,2,Butters,"He's not gonna stop, he's loving all this! He wants the girls to hurt us!
"
20,2,Clyde,"Then let's end it.
"
20,2,Jimmy,"What do you mean?
"
20,2,Clyde,"Cartman is the cause of all our problems. Always. We all know what has to be done. 
"
20,2,Clyde,"It's not like we haven't talked about it before - fantasized about how we'd do it.
"
20,2,Kyle,"Yeah, but not like we'd actually do it.
"
20,2,Stan,"Clyde's right.
"
20,2,Kyle,"Stan... You can't be thinking that we'd-
"
20,2,Stan,"What else do we do Kyle? You know better than anybody what a monster he is.
"
20,2,Tolkien,"He pushed everyone too far.
"
20,2,Butters,"It's him, or us!
"
20,2,Kyle,"Are we seriously talking about doing this?
"
20,2,Craig,"How would we ever get away with it?
"
20,2,Stan,"We do it out in the woods. I know how to get him to go.
"
20,2,Cartman,"'Sup dudes?
"
20,2,Stan,"After school, we're gonna go to my uncle's cabin - in the woods. We're gonna have a slumber party and play Counter-Strike all night with no one around to bother us.
"
20,2,Cartman," Are you serious?! All night broship Counter-Strike party? That's fucking sweet! Does your uncle's cabin have good wifi?
"
20,2,Stan,"Yeah, but don't tell anyone where you're going. We don't want adults to know cause there's gonna be a ton of junk food.
"
20,2,Cartman,"Bros!! Dude, that's so awesome! This is gonna be the best night ever!
"
20,2,Berries,"'Member TIE fighters? Oh, 'member Jawas? 'Member? Hey, 'member Jurassic Park? Ooh, you love Jurassic Park. 'Member Jeff Goldblum? Oh, I 'member Jeff Goldblum - he was really tasty.  I love Jeff Goldblum. 'Member?
"
20,2,Mr. Mackey,"Mueeh...
"
20,2,Scott,"I can't do this anymore! I can't take it!
"
20,2,Mr. Mackey,"Oh! Er, hi Scott. 
"
20,2,Scott,"Nobody ever pays attention to me! Nobody cares! I just want to end it all!
"
20,2,Mr. Mackey,"Scott, come on, we've talked about this. You don't wanna quit Twitter.
"
20,2,Scott,"Why not?! Everyone would be happier if I did!
"
20,2,Mr. Mackey,"Who'd be happier?
"
20,2,Scott,"Everyone.
"
20,2,Mr. Mackey,"Well, what about your parents, huh? How'd you think they'd feel if you quit Twitter?
"
20,2,Scott,"I don't think they'd even notice!
"
20,2,Mr. Mackey,"Of course they'd notice. They'd be saad, m'kay, they'd be saad. You've got so much ahead of you Scott; so many posts and tweets still ahead of you. You haven't even started to see what social media has to offer you. You can't-you can't just end it all. Not now.
"
20,2,Scott,"You're right, I guess I don't want to quit Twitter.
"
20,2,Mr. Mackey,"There you go, m'kay? But now you come back here anytime you're having bad thoughts, m'kay?
"
20,2,Scott,"Okay, thanks.
"
20,2,Scott,"Twitter would be better off without me! I'm quitting!
"
20,2,Mr. Mackey,"Okay, okay. Now, Scott- 
"
20,2,Scott,"What's the point!? Better to just end it all now!
"
20,2,Mr. Mackey,"O-kay...
"
20,2,Cartman,"This is gonna be so awesome. Just hanging with the bros playing Counter-Strike all night. Alone in the woods - you pumped Tolkien?
"
20,2,Tolkien,"Yeah, I'm really excited.
"
20,2,Cartman,"I'm totally gonna do some massive pwnage. Whoever's on my team will be stoked. My laptop's so fast it doesn't lag at all. I can jump around like a pwnage powerhouse.
"
20,2,Clyde,"I'm sure you will.
"
20,2,Cartman,"You guys all seem kinda, like, bummed out. Is everything cool?
"
20,2,Stan,"Everything's fine Cartman. We'll just get there sooner if maybe we don't talk much.
"
20,2,Cartman,"Okay, cool. Goin' a long way to play Counter-Strike. Guess it's sweet though there won't be any adults to screw it up for us. How much further now?
"
20,2,Kyle,"We're almost there.
"
20,2,Cartman,"This place has sweet wifi, right? Gon' be so awesome.
"
20,2,Man,"Oh my God. Oh my God! Oh my God!
"
20,2,Supervisor," What's wrong?
"
20,2,Man,"Someone keeps trolling our campaign site!
"
20,2,Man,"He just keeps leaving horrible comments, and now he's attacking me personally!
"
20,2,Supervisor,"Aww, don't let him get to you.
"
20,2,Man,"Don't let him-?! He took a picture I posted and put a dick in my mouth! Who does that?!
"
20,2,Supervisor,"Someone who probably still lives with his mother and hates himself. He obviously has nothing better to do. Just let him wallow in his own misery.
"
20,2,Man 2,"Get out of the street, you idiot!
"
20,2,Gerald,"Sorry! My bad!
"
20,2,Gerald,"Ha ha! Don't worry!
"
20,2,Berries,"'Member the Cantina? Oh-hoh, I 'member. 'Member Star Destroyers? Yeah, I love Star Destroyers! 'Member?
"
20,2,Woman 3," I have a coupon for that too. An-and those are 6 for $4 with this coupon.  Sorry.
"
20,2,Gerald,"Oh, no please. It's no problem at all!
"
20,2,Scott,"I'm gonna do it!  I'm gonna quit Twitter, I mean it this time!
"
20,2,Mr. Mackey,"Ohh, Scott, uh, I-it's sort of after hours, m'kay?
"
20,2,Scott,"They all laugh at me. They won't be laughing when I do it! I'll show them!
"
20,2,Mr. Mackey,"Hah, alright Scott. Come on inside. Huumm...
"
20,2,Cartman,"Oh, dude, is this it? This is cool. So isolated.  Check it out, there's a shovel next to a hole dug in the ground.
"
20,2,Cartman,"Dude, is this where we're gonna play? I call dibs on this side! What's the wifi called? Is there a password?
"
20,2,Cartman,"I don't see it - I don't see it coming up on my laptop. I don't know, I think maybe the wifi's not working. Where's the box? 
"
20,2,Cartman,"You gotta unplug it and plug it back in.  You guys? You guys...? There's...no wifi...
"
20,2,Clyde,"The girls are gonna do something drastic to us. We have to take matters into our own hands.
"
20,2,Cartman,"What are you...What are you guys talking about - What-
"
20,2,Stan,"You brought this on yourself, Cartman. We're sorry.
"
20,2,Cartman,"Oh my God. Oh my God, you guys are gonna break all my stuff so I can't get online!
"
20,2,Kyle,"Just put your stuff on the table and step back. 
"
20,2,Cartman,"Please! Please don't break my stuff you guys! This is like, 2 Christmases and a birthday worth of stuff! You guys can't do this! Please!
"
20,2,Tolkien,"Let's just get it over with!
"
20,2,Cartman,"No, don't-get-it-over-with! Don't break my stuff! I'm not SkankHunt, I'm not! You guys, you guys, you don't have to do this! You-don't-have-to-do-this! We can still just play Counter-Strike, and forget everything! Oh-my-God, there's no wifi - We can use my phone, to make a hotspot and we can still play Counter-Strike! And it'll be sweet! You guys, come on, please! Please, you can't!
"
20,2,Clyde,"I can't listen to this!
"
20,2,Cartman,"Please, Clyde! Clyde, you're my friend! Please, y-you know how much - I - need - my - stuff!
"
20,2,Craig,"Let's just get it over with! 
"
20,2,Cartman,"No please! If I can't get online, I won't-how would I-I- Mumbling.
"
20,2,Cartman,"No, God! No! Don't! Don't!! Don't!! Oh my God!!
"
20,2,Cartman,"Oh my God!! Oh my God!! Oh my God!! Aahh!! Niah!! Niaah!! Iaahh!! Iaahh!! Niaaahhhh!!!
"
20,2,Stan,"What have we done?
"
20,2,Kyle,"What we had to do.
"
20,2,Cartman," Iaahh!!
"
20,2,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, Goddammit. You've got to be kidding me.  This is Counselor Mackey. What's going on Scott?
"
20,2,Scott,"I swear to God I'm gonna do it this time.
"
20,2,Mr. Mackey,"Okay Scott, just try to calm down. You don't want to quit Twitter.
"
20,2,Scott,"Why does it matter? People would be happier if I just did it!
"
20,2,Mr. Mackey,"That's not true, no one would be happier. 
"
20,2,Mr. Mackey,"This fucking kid, oh my god...  Everybody thinks you're a great kid, Scott.
"
20,2,Scott,"I-I talked to my dad. He said, ""I don't have the guts to do it!"". Well, if I'd quit Twitter, he'd be sorry!
"
20,2,Mr. Mackey,"Okay, umm, how 'bout this, just umm, promise me you won't quit Twitter tonight, and we can - we can talk all day tomorrow, okay? M'kay?
"
20,2,Scott,"I don't know if I'll make it through the night!
"
20,2,Mr. Mackey," Oh, for fuck's sake...
"
20,2,Scott,"I just feel like I'm at the edge of a cliff, you know, and being chased by hate. And the only way out is to jump!
"
20,2,Mr. Mackey," Uh-huh, okay, go on with that.
"
20,2,Scott,"I keep thinking about what the kids at school would do, when they find out I left all my social media. Like they would finally see all the damage they've done.
"
20,2,Mr. Mackey," Goddammit, just do it already...
"
20,2,CNN reporter,"Another internet troll is wreaking havoc on message boards, this time attacking a Danish website for women with breast cancer.
"
20,2,Gerald,"I made the news...
"
20,2,CNN reporter,"The troll, who goes by the name ""SkankHunt42"", ...
"
20,2,Gerald," Yes!
"
20,2,CNN reporter,"...caused the website to temporarily shutdown. Danish Olympic Gold Medalist Freja Ollegard, who started the website, spoke out about the incident. 
"
20,2,Freja Ollegard,"I am not shocked. I am not sad. I am not giving this pitiful person the satisfaction of being anything. .
"
20,2,Freja Ollegard,"This little troll can have his fun. I am going to be the bigger person. I am going to show the people of Denmark are not so easily broken down.
"
20,2,Gerald,"Hmm...Game on whore. Game on.
"
20,2,Kyle,"What's going on?
"
20,2,Stan,"You didn't hear?
"
20,2,Kyle,"Hear what?
"
20,2,Stan,"The troll, SkankHunt, Kyle. He was all over the internet last night!
"
20,2,Kyle,"No, that's impossible!
"
20,2,Stan,"It wasn't him Kyle! We took Cartman out for no reason.  We can't undo what we've done.
"
20,2,Kyle,"Oh my God. Oh my God...
"
20,2,Nelly,"The time has come. We said if the trolling didn't stop, there would be severe consequences. Get the word out to every girl in school. It goes down tomorrow!
"
20,2,Wendy,"Oh my God...I don't know if I can go through with this.
"
20,2,Nichole,"We all have to be on-board Wendy. Every girl in school, or it means nothing.
"
20,2,Annie,"Don't forget what you said Wendy: ""For too long girls here have taken the backseat! Things have to change!"". Now they'll have to listen.
"
20,3,Simply Heidi,"We are back again with the brave Olympic gold medalist from Denmark, Freja Øllengård. Freja, you've talked about being trolled on the Internet and its consequences.
"
20,3,Freja Ollegard,"Yes, Heidi. I believe trolling has a tragic effect on innocent people.
"
20,3,Simply Heidi,"You have been the victim of horrific degrading attacks, spearheaded by a troll called  skankhunt42.
"
20,3,Gerald," Nice.
"
20,3,Freja Ollegard,"I've tried to just ignore the trolls, but that only seems to make them attack me more.
"
20,3,Simply Heidi,"It must be so awful for you to create a Web site for women like yourself who are breat-cancer survivors and these... monsters get on and somehow make light of it. Even going as far as... ridiculing masdectomies.
"
20,3,Freja Ollegard,"Yes, it's very disgusting, but I still try very hard to believe in the goodness of humanity. 
"
20,3,Simply Heidi,"I can tell you that the support for you on our Web site has been overwhelming. We'd like to share some comments we've received, many from doctors who believe your Web site is saving lives. The first is a comment from a physician in Spain: ""You go girl. You are doing great things. Don't let trolling stop you."" And that is from Dr. Juerdior Titsgo , in Spain.
"
20,3,Gerald," He shoots, he scores! 
"
20,3,Simply Heidi,"And there's this one: ""Believe in yourself and don't listen to the haters. You're an inspiration."" That's from Hungarian physician Dr. Cootsier Boobsoff.
"
20,3,Audience Member,"Oh no...
"
20,3,Gerald,"HA!  From the three-point line!
"
20,3,Simply Heidi,"I'm sorry, am I missing something?
"
20,3,Gerald,"Oh! Police!  Yes?
"
20,3,Officer,"Hello, sir, we're conducting an investigation.
"
20,3,Gerald,"Uh... regarding... uh regarding what?
"
20,3,Barkley,"Do you happen to know this child? 
"
20,3,Gerald," Hoooh. Sure, that's one of my son's friends.
"
20,3,Barkley,"Well, I'm afraid he's... quit Twitter.
"
20,3,Gerald,"Hooo... another one, huh?
"
20,3,Barkley,"Yeah, but this one's different. The events surrounding his quitting Twitter were very suspicious. Most people that quit Twitter leave at least three paragraphs stating that they're quitting Twitter before they quit Twitter. This child just stopped using it.
"
20,3,Gerald,"Kyle! 
"
20,3,Barkley,"We're simply trying to gather information on whether this was a Twitter suicide or a Twitter homicide. 
"
20,3,Gerald,"Kyle, have you seen your friend Eric online?
"
20,3,Kyle," No. Uh, he quit.
"
20,3,Barkley,"D'ya happen to know why, son?
"
20,3,Kyle,"He probably got fed up with all the negativity and decided to end it.  I don't know.
"
20,3,Barkley,"Without tweeting a goodbye? People don't just quit social media. They post long drawn-out messages on social media, explaining why they're leaving social media.
"
20,3,Gerald,"Look, officers, why don't you just go ask him why he quit Twitter?
"
20,3,Barkley,"At where, sir? At where?
"
20,3,Kyle,"Okay, that was the cops! The cops were here!
"
20,3,Clyde,"The cops? For what?
"
20,3,Tolkien,"You know for what! You know what we did to Cartman! 
"
20,3,Craig,"We did what we had to do.
"
20,3,Kyle,"But we were wrong!
"
20,3,Butters," It's not the police we have to worry about, it's Eric. He's gonna get us.
"
20,3,Jimmy,"Hey. W-we all just have to stay cool, okay?
"
20,3,Butters,"It doesn't matter. He's comin'. He's comin' to get us.
"
20,3,Randy,"Stan?  You can't just stay in your room all day.
"
20,3,Stan,"What happened, Dad?  Everything's upside down.  Everyone's taking sides and splitting into groups.  Everything sucks.
"
20,3,Randy," Yeah, everything sucks.  Everyone's divided. Nobody's getting along. And there's people like your MOTHER who are thinking of voting for a DOUCHE because she doesn't have a BRAIN.
"
20,3,Sharon," Go to hell, Randy!
"
20,3,Randy,"I don't know what's wrong with people in this town. More and more are agreeing with your mother. I tried getting on community message boards and swaying people's minds but... it always ends up with some asshole talking about vaginas and photoshopping a dick in my mouth. That's where we're at today. Everything sucks.
"
20,3,Aide 1,"Here's everything to prepare you for the debates, ma'am. Just try and stay focused no matter what your opponent says.
"
20,3,Aide 2,"Don't let him rattle you. He's gonna do whatever he can to try and mess with your head. Don't buy into it. Whatever he says, just respond with ""My opponent is a liar, and he cannot be trusted.""
"
20,3,Clinton,"Got it.
"
20,3,Announcer,"Decision 2016. The first Presidential debate, with moderator Lester Holt.
"
20,3,Lester Holt,"Okay, let's get right into it. Our first question is for you, sir. How will you deal with ground troops in Syria?
"
20,3,Garrison,"Everyone, I need to just speak from the heart here. Uhm, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. I've gotta come clean. Uh, I had no idea I would get this far,  but the fact of the matter is, I should not be President. Okay?  I will fuck this country up beyond repair.  I'm a sick, angry little man. Please, if you care at all about the future of our country, vote for her. Okay? She's the one who at least has some experience. She, she's not as bad as you think, I promise. And unlike me, she's actually capable of running this country.
"
20,3,Clinton,"...My opponent is a liar and he cannot be trusted.
"
20,3,Aide 1,"NOOO!
"
20,3,Aide 2,"Oh my God, she's such a turd sandwich.
"
20,3,Clinton,"What he is saying is simply not true. Do not... believe it.
"
20,3,Garrison," I am giving you this, lady. I AM GIVING you this! What the fuck are you doing?!  Okay, look, look, just, vote for her, she... she knows politics. She really wants to put this country first.
"
20,3,Clinton,"My opponent is a liar-
"
20,3,Garrison,"Would you just please shut up?
"
20,3,Clinton,"	-And he cannot be-
"
20,3,Garrison,"Get out of your own way.
"
20,3,Clinton,"-cannot be trusted.
"
20,3,Garrison," Okay, okay, look.  She doesn't mean what she's saying. She just doesn't know how to take this because... it's very weird and her advisers probably t-
"
20,3,Clinton,"My opponent is a liar and he cannot be trusted. 
"
20,3,Garrison,"Fuck, oh fuck, why the fuck does it have to be her? I am so fucked.
"
20,3,PC Principal,"Alright boys, I've had just about enough of playing games.  The four of you were good friends with Eric Cartman, and yet none of you seem to know why he left social media.  Nobody's got anything to say? Well I have a theory. I think... that Eric Cartman... was somehow forced to leave social media as a retaliation for Heidi Turner quitting social media! Now, because of the actions of one sexist, bigoted, racist troll! 
"
20,3,Butters," Eeeaaaahhhh!
"
20,3,PC Principal,"We have a gender war on our hands! Make no mistake, gentlemen! Our community is under attack! And if we don't get to the bottom of it... there's gonna be more students like Eric Cartman... wandering the hallways with no connection to the rest of the world.
"
20,3,Voice," Eric. 
"
20,3,Cartman,"Heidi? Heidi Turner?
"
20,3,Heidi,"Come with me.
"
20,3,Cartman,"Where? 
"
20,3,Heidi,"Join us.  Here.
"
20,3,Cartman,"The park?
"
20,3,Heidi,"I know how you feel, Eric. I know how hard it is when school gets out. With no phone, no human contact.
"
20,3,Cartman," I miss my stuff.
"
20,3,Heidi,"Come on. There are others like us here. 
"
20,3,Driver,"Look at them, Martha. Do you see them?
"
20,3,Martha,"What are they?
"
20,3,Driver,"Lost souls who have quit Twitter. Damned to just wander the earth and hang out and stuff.
"
20,3,Martha,"They seem so lonely. 
"
20,3,Randy,"Okay, what?! The fuck?! Is wrong with you people?! I just saw a new poll that says more and more of you are thinking about voting for that douche!
"
20,3,Stephen,"Some are. A lot of people like what he has to say, alright?
"
20,3,Randy,"You're tellin' me that after that debate, you still wanna vote for that guy?!
"
20,3,Stephen,"More than ever.
"
20,3,Ryan Valmer,"Yyyup.
"
20,3,Randy,"Did you see the same debate I saw?!
"
20,3,Stephen,"Don't you get it, Randy? There's people in this country who are sick and tired. Tired of hearing all the rhetoric. Tired of Washington failing us while they pat their own backs. Finally someone comes along and says what he feels. That's why people like him. You can say what you want, at least he doesn't sound like another politician.
"
20,3,Garrison,"America, please listen to me. I have no idea how to be President. I am a complete jackass, and I have made a giant mistake here.  Nononono, nononono, why are you clapping? I'm not a good person for the White House. I am not a good person, period.
"
20,3,Man,"Finally, someone who doesn't talk like a politician.
"
20,3,Garrison,"I am peeing my pants... at the thought of being President, okay?  No! Shut up! Listen to me!  You don't want a guy like me in the White House! You don't even wanna know the shit I've done!
"
20,3,Random Person,"	Wooohooo!
"
20,3,Garrison,"I have scissored with another woman when I had a sex change!
"
20,3,Man 2,"He's so honest!
"
20,3,Garrison,"No, no! I'm not the guy you want going to Russia to negotiate with Putin. I'll probably end up gettin' drunk and tryin' to suck his dick.  OHHHH JEEEZ
"
20,3,Gerald,"Ike, got a minute?  Let's talk, buddy.  You know, the school really wants us to keep talking to our kids about trolling on the Internet and how serious it is. I guess the troll from the school message boards is now harassing a famous Olympic athlete from Denmark, heh. Have you seen this? Have you heard about this? Yeah well, she kinda called him out and said he could never get her to quit social media, and you know, you might say she's askin' for it. But uh, now this troll is being copied by other trolls who are all dog piling to see if they can get her to quit and, well God only knows what they're gonna do tonight. Well, goodnight, pal. You be sure to let your mom know we talked more about the horrific consequences of trolling. 
"
20,3,Heidi,"	I want to tell you... that I'm sorry.
"
20,3,Cartman,"For what?
"
20,3,Heidi,"	When women first started getting trolled on the school message boards. I was sure it was you. I was wrong.
"
20,3,Cartman,"You weren't the only one. I guess I didn't deserve a second chance. I really tried to make changes. I really tried to become a better person. To sh-show that I was trying to listen.
"
20,3,Heidi,"So when you held the assembly that woman were just as funny as men, you... you weren't being sarcastic?
"
20,3,Cartman," Women are funny, Heidi. Get over it. Every time Amy Schumer talks about her vagina, I lose my fuckin' mind.
"
20,3,Heidi,"	Do you miss your friends?
"
20,3,Cartman,"I don't have any friends. I don't know if I ever did.
"
20,3,Heidi,"You do now. 
"
20,3,Cartman,"Kewl.
"
20,3,Newt Gingrich,"	Hello Florida! Please put your hands together and welcome the next President of the United States! 
"
20,3,Garrison,"I hate all of you so much.
"
20,3,Random Person,"	Yeah!
"
20,3,Garrison,"	I seriously hold so much contempt for each and every one of you pieces of shit.  If you vote me in as President I'll seriously throw up and have lost all faith in humanity. 
"
20,3,Randy,"  I agree.
"
20,3,Garrison,"I don't wanna be here. Please just let me go. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know anything. I'm scared. I'm completely clueless how to proceed. I just... spew bullshit and cry myself to sleep at night. Stop thinking that I'm anything more than a douche in over his head. For fuck's sake, please.
"
20,3,Randy,"	Shit, I'm startin' to really like this guy.
"
20,3,CNN Anchor,"And after stating that he was not fit to be President, Secretary Clinton responded with ""My opponent is a liar and he cannot be trusted.""
"
20,3,Patron,"	I am so confused.
"
20,3,CNN Anchor,"In other news tonight, Danish gold medalist Freja Øllengård is the apparent victim of extreme trolling once again. 
"
20,3,Gerald,"Oh. Eh hey, can you turn that up?
"
20,3,CNN Anchor,"The athlete from Denmark has been the target of relentless online attacks that began with the troll skankhunt42.  Last night the trolling took a vicious turn when Freja Øllengård finally succumbed to the pressure and committed suicide. 
"
20,3,British Field Reporter,"Paul, Danish women's volleyball champion Freja Øllengård has been pronounced dead outside her apartment in Copenhagen.  The four-time girls' medal winner took her own life after jumping 17 floors off the balcony of her building. 
"
20,3,Paul,"Freja Øllengård, dead at the age of 38. 
"
20,3,Gerald," Oh my God! Oh shit! Oh shit oh my God! Oh God oh no-oohh!
"
20,3,Randy,"I was wrong, Stephen, I'm votin' for your guy.
"
20,3,Stephen," What?
"
20,3,Randy,"	It's just...  I see what you mean. He talks like an ordinary person. And he has a lot of the same emotions I do, you know? He's got my vote.
"
20,3,Stephen,"Are you out of your fuckin' mind?
"
20,3,Randy,"  What?
"
20,3,Stephen,"You wanna vote for that douche?! He'll ruin this country!
"
20,3,Randy,"You were just voting for him yesterday!
"
20,3,Stephen,"Yeah, but not anymore!
"
20,3,Randy,"What happened??
"
20,3,Stephen,"I don't know.
"
20,3,Randy,"What the hell is wrong with people?! You just don't flip back and forth like that?!
"
20,3,Stephen,"You just did.
"
20,3,Randy," ...I did. What's going on, Stephen? Why does everything suck this hard?
"
20,3,Stephen,"I don't know. Nobody knows what to think anymore.
"
20,3,Randy,"But how did we get here? Completely confused and with shit for choices? It's like... it's like there are other forces at work.
"
20,3,Stephen,"I'm just tired of thinkin' about it. Come on, let's relax and' have some member berry pie.
"
20,3,Randy," Member berry pie...  Okay, I love member berries. 
"
20,3,Berries,"	'Member Tattooine? 'Member the torture droid? I 'member? Hi, 'member Goonies? I loooved Goonies. 'Member Chunk? 'Member? 'Member the trash compactor? Oh, the trash compactor.
"
20,3,Randy," Wait a minute... 
"
20,3,Troll Hunter," Citizens of Denmark, we are under attack. As our ancestors did in days long ago, we must rise to defend our families.  A troll has come into our village and taken from us a beloved princess. He then returned to his secret hiding place, crawled back to his little cave, thinking the Danes would simply cry and run.  No. What this troll doesn't realize is that we have been planning our own attack. I'm announcing here and to the world that a plan to destroy the troll is underway. For in Denmark there is one thing we have known for centuries. To get the troll to come out of hiding, you must say its name.
"
20,3,Heidi,"Hey.
"
20,3,Cartman,"	Hey.  I was thinking again. About how women are just as funny as men. And then I realized... that the only way to really be sure is to see if African-Americans think they're funny.
"
20,3,Heidi,"Why is that?
"
20,3,Cartman,"Because, black laughs matter.
"
20,3,Heidi,"...Is that a joke?
"
20,3,Cartman,"Yes, it is.
"
20,3,Heidi,"I don't get it.
"
20,3,Cartman,"Yes, you do.  Heidi, does it ever get any easier? Living in this world?
"
20,3,Heidi,"The hardest part is not having any followers. I used to go places just to show them where I was.
"
20,3,Cartman,"You wanna go somewhere? I'll follow you. 
"
20,3,Jud,"Mornin'. How can I help ya?
"
20,3,Randy,"Yeah, I have some questions about uh member berries?
"
20,3,Jud,"Yeah'. Everyone wants member berries these days.  Right over heah.  Don't know what makes them so popular. I've had to get rid of all mah pumpkins, mah onions and mah peppahs, just to make room for more membah berries. 
"
20,3,Randy,"Oh my God, there's this many?
"
20,3,Berries,"'Member the 80s? Oh, 'member the 90s? Yeah yeah, but 'member the 80s though? Nonono, 'member the 90s?
"
20,3,Gerald,"Oh God! Oh God! Oh God! Oh God! Oh God! Protocol Zero. No evidence, clear history. E-mails! delete, delete, delete, erase, erase, trash, trash. 
"
20,3,Shelia,"I saw Nancy Morris today. She has a different hair color. Again. I swear she doesn't think anyone even notices. Her natural hair color must be clear.
"
20,3,Gerald," Our computer's broke.
"
20,3,Shelia,"...What?
"
20,3,Gerald,"	It broke and I had to throw it away.
"
20,3,Shelia,"I thought if a computer isn't working, you try and get it fixed.
"
20,3,Gerald,"	No now you just throw it away.
"
20,3,Shelia,"You had all my recipes on that FileMaker program on your computer.
"
20,3,Gerald,"I'll get us a new computer tomorrow. Then I can see if we can pull your recipes up from Ike's computer, and that way we- Ike's computer! Shit! 
"
20,3,Gerald,"Move move move!  My computer is off the network, and, and this computer didn't mirror that computer, but they did share the same Time Machine schedule, so then, would any of my files be accessible? No, because they didn't know each other's IP addresses. What if you can access my e-mail account from this computer through iCloud? If I go to iCloud, my e-mails are deleted. Good. Except there's a new e-mail.  That shouldn't have come in. Why would an e-mail to me have come in if I deleted everything?  ""I know who you are.""  You? Do you know who I am? Do you know who I am, Ike?
"
20,3,Ike,"No, but I want to, Dad.
"
20,3,Gerald," Not like that, smartass!  Delete! Delete the account, not the e-mails!  ""meet me under the freemont bridge. 9 am tomorrow.""  Oh God...
"
20,3,Heidi,"You dip your French fries in the sweet & sour sauce?
"
20,3,Cartman,"Yeah. It's the best, dude. Try it.
"
20,3,Heidi," Wow, that's really good. I'm starting to feel like life isn't gonna be so bad.
"
20,3,Cartman,"Yeah. I think I am too. Heidi, can I ask you something?
"
20,3,Heidi,"	Yeah, of course.
"
20,3,Cartman,"	Do girls... not have balls?
"
20,3,Heidi,"Girls do not have balls, no
"
20,3,Cartman,"So when a girl goes to scratch her balls, how does that work?  I just don't understand what's at the bottom of a vagina.
"
20,3,Heidi," Do you want me to show you?
"
20,3,Cartman,"	...Holy shiiit.
"
20,4,Narrator,"Long ago, in the deep and frozen lands of Scandinavia, there were creatures who wreaked havoc on humanity.  The Troll. They dwell in rocks, in caves, isolated from civilization. The creatures were ugly, fat and slow-witted, but some could look and behave like human beings. These are the most dangerous. Now, the creatures have returned, this time, a thousand miles across the sea.  Today, the monsters believe they can go undetected,  free to attack and then retreat to the darkness. But in Denmark, we have dealt with the trolls before, and now and now, we shall deal with them... again.
"
20,4,Kyle,"Dad, can I talk to you?
"
20,4,Gerald,"Sure, Kyle.
"
20,4,Kyle,"All the girls at school are really mad. It's like, one guy gets online and says terrible things about girls and it reflects badly on all of us.
"
20,4,Gerald,"Uh huh.
"
20,4,Kyle,"Everyone's sad, everyone's depressed and nobody knows how to move forward.
"
20,4,Gerald,"Good.
"
20,4,Kyle,"I guess what I'm saying is, I'm starting to feel a lot of guilt, just for being a boy. How do I not feel that?
"
20,4,Gerald,"Sorry Kyle, I have to meet someone. Talk to your mother.  I love you! 
"
20,4,Butters,"It's been a rough few weeks, Baby. The girls are still mad about being trolled on the school message board, parents are all freaking out about the election and, and I tell you... you are glad to not be living in this country right now.
"
20,4,Charlotte,"Butters, I'm sorry, but I told you not to Skype me anymore, right?
"
20,4,Butters," But Baby, I love you! I need you! You can't break up with me!
"
20,4,Charlotte,"I have to stand with my girlfriends.
"
20,4,Butters,"Oh my god, I can't believe they got to you.  Those sneaky snakes in the grass!
"
20,4,Charlotte,"Who?!
"
20,4,Butters,"Well you know who, the girls in my school! They all broke up with their boyfriends and now they got you to go along with them!
"
20,4,Charlotte,"This is a time when women and girls have to stick together.
"
20,4,Butters,"So then it's true! You're all snakes in the grass! Every  last one of you!
"
20,4,Charlotte,"
"
20,4,Butters,"Oh Charlotte?  Are you there?  Honey?
"
20,4,Gerald," I don't know why you are harassing me. I don't even own a computer.
"
20,4,Dick,"My name is Dick.
"
20,4,Gerald,"Are you with the NSA or Homeland Security?
"
20,4,Dick,"No! I'm a colleague.
"
20,4,Gerald,"A colleague?
"
20,4,Dick,"You probably know me as ""Dildo Shwaggins"".
"
20,4,Gerald,"Dildo Shwaggins from Pussystores.org?!
"
20,4,Dick,"We need to talk.
"
20,4,Gerald,"You're just a troll?!  Oh thank god!
"
20,4,Dick,"We're on the same team, Skankhunt.
"
20,4,Gerald," Wait, but that means I went ""Protocol Zero"" for nothing. Oh shit !
"
20,4,Dick,"What's ""Protocol Zero""?
"
20,4,Gerald," Everything's gone! I destroyed my computers, my phone!  Why couldn't you just say, ""I know who you are. I'm a troll too,""? Why do you have to be so fucking cryptic?!
"
20,4,Dick,"Us trolls have to be careful.  You know that.
"
20,4,Gerald,"Look, I'm not really a troll, okay? I just started as a Yelp reviewer and got sick of how everyone's stupid comments sounded.  I just like messing with people 'cause it was funny. I got carried away!
"
20,4,Dick,"These are really dangerous times, Skankhunt. There are there are things happening in the world and trolls have to come together.
"
20,4,Gerald,"For what?
"
20,4,Dick,"Someone is trying to wipe us out! Our way of life is in danger.
"
20,4,Gerald,"It's not a way of life! I was just doing it for the LOLs.
"
20,4,Dick,"That's not true. I've studied your work. You're one of the best trolls I have ever seen.
"
20,4,Gerald," No, no! I am done with this crap. I thought my wife was going to find out,  but that was too spooky. .
"
20,4,Dick,"Gerald, we need each other. The Danish  are planning something horrible against us.
"
20,4,Gerald," I'm not one of you, okay? I just need to stop. .
"
20,4,Kyle," Guys, I've been thinking this over a lot and ... we need to be more active in showing the girls that we respect them. There's a big girl-volleyball game tonight and we should all go and show our support.
"
20,4,Stan,"You really think that's gonna make a difference?
"
20,4,Kyle,"I do. We need to show the girls that not all boys aren't the same and that we are willing to change. 
"
20,4,Butters,"Well why don't you just shut the fuck up, Kyle?  All I've been hearing in a few weeks is how this is our fault, how boys need to change. Well I'm getting pretty sick of it. Everyone else seems to be proud about who they are, but not us; and then we get Uncle Kyle here telling us that the girls are right!
"
20,4,Kyle,"Butters?
"
20,4,Butters," This is a war  on all of us. You want to listen to Uncle Kyle, we'll go ahead. Pretty soon  they'll be locking us all up. And don't think you're safe either, Tweek and Craig. Just 'cause you're gay does not mean that you aren't looked down upon for being boys!  The world wants us all to feel shame just because we were all born with  wieners!
"
20,4,Kyle,"Butters, you need to calm down.
"
20,4,Butters,"No!  We tried doing it your way, Kyle. We tried doing what the girls wanted us to do and where did it get us?
"
20,4,Clyde,"Nowhere.
"
20,4,Butters," Right! It turned us against one of our own match, that's what it did! What happened to Eric Cartman is the girl's fault, not ours!
"
20,4,Tolkien,"That's true!
"
20,4,Butters,"I'm done feeling guilt. I'm a boy, dang nab it! And you know what? I'm proud of my little wiener. Mark my words, the moment is coming when you all need to decide; are you with your kind,  or are you with Uncle Kyle.
"
20,4,Sheila,"Gerald, you've been sitting at the table for three hours now. You okay?
"
20,4,Gerald," I'm great! Totally good. Just sitting down and ... doing nothing. Is there a problem with that? Is there a problem with just wanting to sit and just be? Is that illegal now?
"
20,4,Sheila,"Not at all, Gerald. I'm sorry.
"
20,4,Gerald,"I'm totally happy. I'm happy. I don't need to do anything to make me happy, fuck.
"
20,4,Sheila,"Well! I know you said your computer was broken. So, I went ahead and got you something.  Here, it's your own iPad.
"
20,4,Gerald," Ah! Ah ah, ah! No, no! I'm good. Get that away from me.
"
20,4,Sheila," You don't like it?
"
20,4,Gerald,"No, sorry! I love it! I'm just swearing off electronics for a little bit.  Or maybe I can just get on a couple of message boards.  No, I'm good! I don't need it!
"
20,4,Sheila,"Gerald,  what's going on?
"
20,4,Gerald,"Nothing, Sheila. I'm fine.  I'm just trying to make some changes and less electronics is part of it. I'm sorry, Honey. Everything is okay. Promise.
"
20,4,Sheila,"Okay, Gerald. I'll make us some lunch.  Oh uh, did that guy outside talk to you?
"
20,4,Gerald," What guy outside?  What the fuck?  Go away, go!  Go! Go away! Go go!
"
20,4,Dick,"
"
20,4,Gerald,"
"
20,4,Sports Commentator,"Welcome students and parents to tonight's matchup between the South Park Cows and the Bona Festa Demons.
"
20,4,Kyle,"Dude, this is awesome! Did you see how many of the boys I've got to come out tonight?!
"
20,4,Stan,"Yeah! This is a pretty sweet turnout!
"
20,4,Wendy,"
"
20,4,Kyle,"This is exactly what we needed. Thank god people listen to me.
"
20,4,Referee,"
"
20,4,Sports Commentator,"And now please sit, stand, or kneel for the National Anthem.
"
20,4,Butters,"
"
20,4,Jason,"Holy crap, dude. Look at Butters.
"
20,4,Kyle,"Oh  no!
"
20,4,Gerald," Son a bitch! Ahhh! 
"
20,4,Randy,"Gerald. Hey come on in. You're not alone, bud. We're all facing the same struggles and trying to do something about it. Anyways please continue, Richard.
"
20,4,Gerald,"
"
20,4,Richard,"Well like I was saying, I've been addicted to memberberries for the past two months now.
"
20,4,Randy,"It's okay, man. You're not alone.
"
20,4,Richard,"It's just, you know, 'membering is more fun than thinking. I want so bad to go back to when things were good. When I was a kid, you know like, the 80s and the 90s, and things made sense.
"
20,4,Randy,"And that's how we got here to this very memberberry election.
"
20,4,Gerald,"What is this?!
"
20,4,Randy,"What have been your struggles with memberberries, Gerald?
"
20,4,Gerald,"I, I don't even know what a member--.
"
20,4,Berries," 'Member the Dagobah? Yeah, I remember the Dagobah. That's where Yoda lives. 'Member Yoda?! Oh, I 'member!
"
20,4,Randy," Michael, are there memberberries in your pocket?
"
20,4,Berries,"Oh, 'member Corellian Corvette?! I remember Corellian Corvette!
"
20,4,Michael," Nope!
"
20,4,Randy,"Anyway, Gerald, what has your experience been?
"
20,4,Gerald,"I don't even know what memberberries are.
"
20,4,Stephen,"Gerald, come on. The first step towards healing is admitting you've got a problem.
"
20,4,Gerald,"Yeah.  Well you've got a fat pussy, and you should go and fucking kill yourself!  Sorry, I think I'm in the wrong place. 
"
20,4,PC Principal,"Make no mistake! I want to be very upset. However, as a community, we have all decided that people have the right to protest the National Anthem.
"
20,4,Wendy,"They took their wieners out!
"
20,4,PC Principal," Correct!  But they did so peacefully and without malice towards others.
"
20,4,Wendy,"This was an attack on us. This is exactly why we sat out the National Anthem in the first place!
"
20,4,PC Principal,"I want you to understand something, ladies.  I am in a PC Pretzel here because if I say  they can't protest even though  you protested  and the only difference is that their protest included physical gestures, then I'm body shaming!
"
20,4,Bebe,"So you're just gonna let the boys take their wieners out whenever they want?
"
20,4,PC Principal,"That's what happens when you sit out the National Anthem.
"
20,4,Butters," We walk together in peace! We walk together in pride! We're not gonna feeling ashamed for who we are! We're not gonna feel guilt for the way we were born! Wieners out!
"
20,4,Wieners Out boys (except Butters),"Wieners out!
"
20,4,Butters,"Don't let anyone tell you you are somehow less because you're a boy! Don't let anyone tell you to not think with your wiener, as if your wiener is a bad thing!
"
20,4,Wieners Out boys (except Butters),"Yeah!
"
20,4,Butters,"What makes us different makes us beautiful! No more shame, no more doubt, no more bigotry!
"
20,4,Wendy,"
"
20,4,Wieners Out boys (except Butters),"Wieners out!
"
20,4,Butters,"Don't be an Uncle Kyle! Be proud of who you are!
"
20,4,Stan,"
"
20,4,Butters,"You are either with us or against us! It's really that simple!
"
20,4,Gerald," Damn it!  I live here! Stop that! 
"
20,4,Sheila," You don't have to work tonight?
"
20,4,Gerald,"No, nothing!
"
20,4,Sheila,"Wow! I don't remember the last time you were able to get in bed the same time as me.
"
20,4,Gerald,"Got all caught up with work!
"
20,4,Sheila,"Hey, I'm not complaining.  It feels good to have you here.
"
20,4,Gerald," I'm going on a run!
"
20,4,Gerald," Ah!  Fuck you!  Fuck you!
"
20,4,Gerald," Yeah!
"
20,4,Sheila,"
"
20,4,Gerald,"Screw you, Skank! You fat little bitch! Go kill yourself, whore!
"
20,4,Shiela,".
"
20,4,Gerald,"Yeah, fuck you, bitch! Fuck you! 
"
20,4,Sheila,"Gerald? 
"
20,4,Gerald," Oh, sorry, Hun! Sorry!
"
20,4,Kyle,"Everyone all right, guys?
"
20,4,Gerald,"Everything's fine, Kyle. Go back to bed.
"
20,4,Sheila," One night you, you say all of our computer stuff is broken and you, you hide everything and then you show up with all of this new equipment and now this! Please, tell me what's going on!
"
20,4,Gerald,"Nothing is going on!
"
20,4,Sheila," You hissed at me! You went .
"
20,4,Gerald,"Okay, okay. I'm going to tell you the truth, Sheila. I watch porn on the Internet. I'm sorry. I'll try to stop.
"
20,4,Sheila,"But I know you watch porn. You told me you watched porn and I told you that I don't care, Gerald.
"
20,4,Gerald,"Oh yeah! But uh, it's uh, but this is different.
"
20,4,Sheila,"Why?! Because it's not normal porn?
"
20,4,Gerald,"Right!
"
20,4,Sheila,"Like something really embarrassing?
"
20,4,Gerald,"It's really embarrassing.
"
20,4,Sheila,"Tell me!
"
20,4,Gerald,"It's... porn! It's... uh, piss! Porn! Piss porn!
"
20,4,Sheila,"Piss porn? Like people peeing on each other?
"
20,4,Gerald," See?!  It's so embarrassing! No wonder I hid it, right?!  Whew!  I'm sorry! It's good to get it out in the open though. 
"
20,4,Sheila,"Do you want me to pee on you?
"
20,4,Gerald," No!
"
20,4,Sheila,"You only like watching other women pee?
"
20,4,Gerald," Oh no, no! It's not like that.
"
20,4,Sheila," Because they're pretty? You have to watch around a video because I'm overweight and old?
"
20,4,Gerald,"No! I, I, I want you to! I just couldn't ask.
"
20,4,Sheila,"You do, promise? 
"
20,4,Gerald," Yes?
"
20,4,Sheila,"Am I doing it right, Gerald?
"
20,4,Gerald,"Yep! 
"
20,4,Ike,"
"
20,4,Gerald,"So hot, I mean  warm! 
"
20,4,Kyle,"
"
20,4,Kyle,"Hi, Cartman.
"
20,4,Cartman," Hey, Kyle.
"
20,4,Kyle,"I'm so sorry, what we did to you. This Internet troll has everyone going crazy. We shouldn't have assumed it was you. We shouldn't have broke all of your stuff.
"
20,4,Cartman,"Cool. That's cool.
"
20,4,Kyle,"No! I know it's not cool. I know you're figuring out how to get back at us.
"
20,4,Cartman,"I saw a vagina, Kyle.
"
20,4,Kyle,"What?!
"
20,4,Cartman,"I'm not holding a grudge. I'm happier now. I have purpose.
"
20,4,Kyle,"You saw who's vagina?
"
20,4,Cartman,"My girlfriend's. She stood six feet away and flashed it really fast. But in that instant, you know what I saw? I saw that humankind can colonize Mars. I saw the potential of our species to terraform other planets and reach the infinite.
"
20,4,Kyle," Yeah right, okay.  I'm being serious, Cartman. Butters needs to be taken down a notch and you're the best at that.
"
20,4,Heidi," Eric, hey! I got us both chocolate milks.
"
20,4,Cartman," Of course you did 'cause you're amazing. Look at what I made you.
"
20,4,Heidi,"The pink and blue one?!
"
20,4,Cartman,"That's what my baby wanted.
"
20,4,Heidi," Yay,  put it on me!
"
20,4,Cartman," Oh sorry. Heidi, you know Kyle?
"
20,4,Heidi," Oh yeah. Hey, Kyle.  The show's on at five tonight if you want to watch it at your house or my house.
"
20,4,Cartman,"Oh either way, we totally can. I, I guess Kyle has something to talk to us something about first, um.  Go ahead, Kyle.
"
20,4,Kyle," The, the school is in trouble and, um our friends are...
"
20,4,Cartman,"He said something about us working together to take down Butters.
"
20,4,Heidi,"Why? What's going on, Boo?
"
20,4,Cartman,"I'm not sure, Boo.  Could you start from the beginning, Kyle?  Heidi is amazing at figuring stuff out.
"
20,4,Kyle,"
"
20,4,Gerald,"It wasn't suppose to be like this. I just thought it was funny making people get wild up. It was just stupid-harmless-lock-room humor, till I made that lady kill herself.
"
20,4,Dick," You can't deny who you are, Skankhunt.
"
20,4,Gerald," Don't call me that here! Why can't you just go away?!
"
20,4,Dick,"Because we're all in danger. Didn't you see the video I sent you?
"
20,4,Gerald,"No! Don't you get it?! I went ""Protocol Zero""! I broke my phone, I delete all my email accounts so that nobody can trace me  ever again!
"
20,4,Dick,"They will be able to,  everyone. You need to see this video, Skankhunt. The whole world is about to change.
"
20,4,Cartman," You want to know what's really going on? I'll tell you what's going on. Even though women have made great gains in the last century, there are still a part of men who aren't comfortable with women having power. It really just comes down to that, and then you have social media which allows men to anonymously say horrific things like ""Women aren't funny,"" even though Heidi's like the funniest person I'be ever met.
"
20,4,Heidi,"Shut up.
"
20,4,Cartman," No, it's true. Get over yourself.
"
20,4,Kyle,"
"
20,4,Heidi,"I don't even try to be funny.
"
20,4,Cartman,"I know. You don't have to 'cause you're awesome.
"
20,4,Kyle,"Cartman, will you just help me mess with Butters to stop his little agroclub from getting any bigger?
"
20,4,Cartman," Like mess with Butters how?  What do you mean ""mess with Butters""? 
"
20,4,Kyle,"You know what I mean. Come on! We need the old Cartman back!
"
20,4,Cartman," Oh I see! You have a problem with Heidi.
"
20,4,Heidi,"What?
"
20,4,Cartman,"You're threatened by her because she actually has interesting things to say and she is funnier than you.
"
20,4,Kyle,"That's not true at all!
"
20,4,Cartman," Oh she's not funnier than you,  or is she just not funny because she's a girl?
"
20,4,Heidi,"Babe, stop. I don't think he meant anything by it.
"
20,4,Cartman," Sorry, babe. It just really ruffles my feathers.
"
20,4,Heidi," Look, Kyle, I think it's great you're trying to patch things up with everyone, but the truth is Eric and I are just kind of out of it now.
"
20,4,Cartman," Look, Kyle, we're just out of it now.
"
20,4,Heidi,"We gave up social media and the ugliness that goes along with it and we're in a better place.
"
20,4,Cartman,"Humans on Mars.
"
20,4,Dick,"I'm warning you, Skankhunt,  this video is really gonna rock your world.
"
20,4,Gerald," Can you please call me ""Gerald""?!
"
20,4,Dick," It's very obscure news story from the BBC in England. Hardly anyone has seen it over here.  This is why we all have to come together, Skank.
"
20,4,BBC reporter,"Since the dawn of the Internet, message boards and chat rooms have lit up with people who insight and insult for no apparent reason. They're called  trolls, and a controversial company in Denmark is working to make them a thing of the pass. ""The days of trolls hiding behind nicknames and message boards are over!"" the Danish claim.  As a new website,  Trolltrace.com will soon be up and running. In less than a month, the servers will become active. Anyone can take any troll comment and send it through the Danish service where a real name and real physical address will be attached.
"
20,4,Bedrager," Every message, every comment  ever made by trolls will retroactively be given a tag  with the author's name, location, and  whole Internet history.
"
20,4,Gerald," Fffffuuuuuccckkk!
"
20,4,Dick,"I told you.
"
20,4,BBC reporter,"And this is the man who has masterminded it all.
"
20,4,Bedrager,"What this will allow people to do is trace back harmful and hateful postings or emails. You see, the troll hides behind a protective layer if you will that Internet enmity provides. We intend to strip them of that protection so that everyone will know who they are.
"
20,4,BBC reporter,"And what about people who will use this to spy on others who aren't trolls?
"
20,4,Bedrager,"Uh, what do you mean?
"
20,4,BBC reporter,"Once your servers become active, anyone can trace anything onto the Internet back to whoever wrote it. How do you stop that from happening?
"
20,4,Bedrager,"Oh oh, right.  This service is only for tracing the identity of trolls. Thank you. Kom ud trold, komme ud og dø.
"
20,4,Dick,"I Google Translated the last part. He said ""Come out troll, come out and die"".
"
20,4,Gerald,"This can't be happening.
"
20,4,Dick,"By next week, everything everyone has ever done online is going to be available to the public.
"
20,4,Gerald," Then it's over. I'm dead.
"
20,4,Dick," You're not dead, Skankhunt. There's still hope.
"
20,4,Kyle," Everyone, can I have your attention please?!  I know the past few weeks have been very difficult, for all of us. I know now more than ever that something has to change. I thought a lot about this the past few days. I've seen a lot of things I never thought I would have see. These are all complex issues we're all having to face, and now that I know that after you break it down, there's really only one answer. 
"
20,4,Boys,"Yeah! 
"
20,4,Butters,"Good for you, Uncle Kyle!
"
20,4,Dick," Fellow trolls, let me introduce you to Skankhunt42.
"
20,4,Gerald,"I'm not necessarily Skankhunt42.
"
20,4,Troll #1,"It's okay, Skank. You're with your kind.
"
20,5,Jason,"Hit her!
"
20,5,Douglas,"Stupid girl!
"
20,5,Daniel,"Hit her, man!
"
20,5,Annie,"Kick his ass, Nelly!
"
20,5,Red,"All boys should die!
"
20,5,Lola,"Take him out!
"
20,5,Nelly,"I don't care if you're a boy, I'm gonna kick your ass!
"
20,5,Butters," Anytime anywhere, skank.
"
20,5,Boys (except Butters),"Yeah!
"
20,5,Nelly,"Pull up your stupid pants first.
"
20,5,Butters,"Why? You're afraid to fight me like a man?
"
20,5,Clyde,"Kick her ass, Butters. She called you stupid.
"
20,5,Wendy,"He is stupid! Look at him!
"
20,5,Jimmy,"At least he's not a zzzzitty-faced ggirl.
"
20,5,Boys (expect Butters and Jimmy),"Yeah!
"
20,5,Cartman," Hey hey hey! Whoa, guys! Guys!  Hasn't this gone on long enough? Aren't we tired of being so divided at skewl?
"
20,5,Annie,"Get out of here, Cartman; nobody's buying it.
"
20,5,Red,"Yeah, everyone knows you're the worst!
"
20,5,Heidi,"Hey, leave him alone!  Eric tries to help  and you call him names?!  Sorry, babe, I had to step in.
"
20,5,Cartman,"It's cool, Baby.
"
20,5,Wendy,"Heidi?!
"
20,5,Annie,"
"
20,5,Cartman,"Heidi has been really hurt by all of this, you guys. And I think it's time for us to all try to come together, as a skewl.
"
20,5,Advisor #1,"All right sir , don't be nervous for your speech; I know we're down a bit in the polls, but there's still a great chance we can win the Swing States.
"
20,5,Garrison,"There's  still a chance, are you serious?!
"
20,5,Publicist #1,"Just one thing sir, be a little careful of what you say about women. Uh, seems like that might be losing us some votes. 
"
20,5,Garrison," Oh you don't say?
"
20,5,Chris Christie,"Ladies and gentlemen, out country's divided like never before. And we all know that only one man has the guts to say what we're all thinking. Please, welcome the man who with your help will soon be the next President of the United States! 
"
20,5,Crowd Members,"Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! 
"
20,5,Garrison,"So I'm standin' in line at the airport, waitin' in security 'cause of all the freakin' Muslims. 
"
20,5,Supporter,"Ow!
"
20,5,Garrison,"And the TSA security people all look like black thugs from the inner city; I'm like ""Oh good, you're gonna protect us?""  Well maybe it's good they're all gang members. At least they can tell the difference between Muslims and Mexicans, 'cause God knows I can't.  You know, I'm standin' there in line and you know what I do? I stick my finger in this chick's asshole,  and she turns to me and says, ""Hey, aren't you that guy that's running for President?"" I say Yeah. She says ""Why you got your finger in my ass?"" I say ""I'm just keeping it warm, honey, 'cause that chick next to you is way hotter and I'm gonna stick it in her clam.""  Yeah, let's make America great again. No dude wants his finger in some ugly bitch's ass.  You gotta be careful though, it's only about half an inch away, you know, that asshole and that clam, so you gotta be careful. Right dudes?  Oh. Oh, where are you goin'? Are you leavin?  I'm sorry, did I offend you? Where did I lose you, honey? You've been okay with the ""fuck everyone to death,"" all the Muslim and Mexican shit, but fingers in the ass did it for ya?  Cool, just wanted to see where your line was!  Oh yeah, look, I guess some more broads are leavin'. Oh Jeez you were so on board, I can't believe I let that little offensive mark slip. Poor girls. Did you get your feelings hurt after ""Fuck all the immigrants"" and?"" Jeez, I'm sorry. Jeez.
"
20,5,Bedrager," Hello. Are you tired of hate speech? Are you sick of sexism and-a bigotry? Then please, help the Danish put an end to trolls.
"
20,5,Danes,"Tjing tjang tjing nutillej.
"
20,5,Bedrager,"Right now, the people of Denmark are working on a biometric computer superstructure which will allow people all around the world to identify the trolls in their communities.
"
20,5,Danes,"Tjing tjang tjing nutillej.
"
20,5,Bedrager,"But to make this dream into a reality, we still need your donations. We are just a few million kroners away, so please donate via the social media of your choice.
"
20,5,Danes," Tjing tjang tjing nutillej.
"
20,5,Bedrager,"Just imagine it, knowing who said what on the Internet.
"
20,5,Dane 1,"The whole world will be-a peaceful and happy.
"
20,5,Dane 2,"Like-a here, in Denmark.
"
20,5,Dane 3,"Help fund our project on social media today!
"
20,5,Danes,"Together, we will rid the world of trolls. Tjing tjang lu, Tjing tjang lu, Tjing tjang tjing nutillej!
"
20,5,Dick,"Fellow trolls, we have gathered together because our anonymity is being threatened. Individually, we are some of the most notorious trolls in Colorado. We must now find a way to unite. Each one of us has the power to make message boards go haywire, The power to make individuals buckle and fall. Imagine if we use those skills against a common enemy.
"
20,5,Troll #2,"They have an entire government at their disposal.
"
20,5,Dick,"And we... have Skankhunt42.
"
20,5,Gerald," It's Gerald. Alright?
"
20,5,Dick,"I believe that he... is the key to stopping all this.
"
20,5,PC Principal,"Alright everyone, listen up. This school is falling apart, and it needs to stop. Boys are harassing girls, and girls are stereotyping boys as- Not now, Mr. Stotch! Put it away!
"
20,5,Butters," Well okay. 
"
20,5,PC Principal,"Now I've asked for some ideas and a couple of students wanna try and help. Please welcome Heidi and Eric. 
"
20,5,Cartman,"Hey you guys?
"
20,5,Heidi,"What's up? 
"
20,5,Cartman,"Guys, we have a lot of problems facing our skewl. I don't know if many of you know Heidi but she's really smart and really funny.
"
20,5,Heidi,"Eheh, stop, Eric.
"
20,5,Cartman,"You are. And she's come up with a pretty cool idea. Tell 'em, baby.
"
20,5,Heidi,"Thanks, babe. I don't know if you guys have heard, but right now, Denmark is trying to make trolling a thing of the past. They're asking for help, and I thought ""why not a school fundraiser?""
"
20,5,Cartman,"Yeah, but the way you said it was actually way funnier, remember?
"
20,5,Heidi,"What? How did I say it? 
"
20,5,Cartman,"Remember, you were like ""Oh, what if we had a fundraiser?"" in uh, what was it?  Remember, you- it was like uh-
"
20,5,Heidi,"When was this? Were we at Denny's?
"
20,5,Cartman,"	Yeah, we were having uhh, that dessert thing. What was that, that-?
"
20,5,Heidi," Oh, and you kept spilling it and everything?
"
20,5,Cartman,"Yeah, yeah, remember? Remember that there was that, that guy that had that, what was it
"
20,5,Heidi,"He had that weird haircut and you kept saying that it looked like he had a dick on his head.
"
20,5,Cartman,"Yeah yeah yeah, that's when you said that- don't let anybody-  Oh hey guys. Wha-what's up? Oh right. A school fundraiser. Tomorrow, we'll be going to each individual class with more information. And after that...
"
20,5,Heidi,"Then we should all come together  as a skewl. 
"
20,5,Advisor #1,"Sir, what were you thinking? We said to be careful how you talked about women.
"
20,5,Garrison," Yeah I don't know, I guess I just kind of screwed the pooch on that one. 
"
20,5,Chris Christie,"We are way down in the polls. I don't know how we recover from this.
"
20,5,Garrison,"Oh really? Jeez that's too bad. 
"
20,5,Chris Christie,"A lot of us have staked our lives on backing you! You can't just go bonkers like this!
"
20,5,Garrison,"Hey, sorry. I didn't realize women were racists.
"
20,5,Advisor 2,"You have... millions of supporters who are looking to you to lead! They're gonna wanna know what you're gonna do about this!
"
20,5,Garrison,"I mean, I don't know. Nothin'. Whatever.
"
20,5,Chris Christie,"You wanna tell them that? They're outside. 
"
20,5,Supporter 1,"What's goin' on?!
"
20,5,Supporter 2,"What are ya doin?!
"
20,5,Garrison," Oh, uh hey everybody. Uh, looks like we're tanking in the polls, but you know what? It's fixed. I was never gonna win in the first place. I knew it from the beginning. And on November 8th, when I lose, I'll be able to say ""I told you so!"" 
"
20,5,Supporter 2,"This son of a bitch pulled a fast one on us!
"
20,5,Supporter 3,"It's like he's not even trying!
"
20,5,Garrison,"Oh no, I'm I'm trying. I just-
"
20,5,Supporter 2,"Get him!
"
20,5,Garrison,"Shiiit!  Ohhh Jeeez! 
"
20,5,Supporters,"Kill him! Tear his head off! Don't let him get away!
"
20,5,Supporter 4," Yeah haw!
"
20,5,Andrew,"
"
20,5,Anonymous821,"What do you want? Go away.
"
20,5,Andrew,"Hey, just checking to see if you needed any more refreshments for the conference room?
"
20,5,Anyomous821,"We're fine. We don't need anything.
"
20,5,A Troll," Some more creamer?
"
20,5,Anonymous821,"Just some more creamer.
"
20,5,Andrew,"Alright, well, I just wanna say ""thanks for choosing the-"" 
"
20,5,Anonymous821,"Okay, we're clear again.
"
20,5,Dick,"You were saying, Skankhunt?
"
20,5,Gerald,"Alright, look. How do you troll somebody?
"
20,5,Troll 4,"Say really fucked up shit and make them quit social media?
"
20,5,Gerald,"No, no, no, it's not about one person. It's about pushing people's buttons so that they'll react in a way that pushes other people's buttons. Look, you don't just troll a woman with cancer to get a reaction from her, it's all about the group of people that are gonna come to her defense. They're gonna be so self-righteous that another group of people will eventually find those people totally annoying. You're just setting them against each other. It's like the fission reaction that sets off the fusion explosion. The Internet does it all, and you just sit back with your glass of wine and laugh.
"
20,5,Anonymous821,"Wow... that seems kind of... mean.
"
20,5,Gerald,"It's not mean if it's hilarious.
"
20,5,Dick,"If we all worked with you, Skank, could we do it? Could we troll an entire country?
"
20,5,Gerald,"If we all worked together? Maybe.  Maybe.
"
20,5,Heidi,"Hey guys. Today we're gonna start our school fundraiser. It's an idea I came up with called ""Danishes for Denmark.""
"
20,5,Cartman," It's awesome. You're doing awesome.
"
20,5,Heidi,"We need everyone to do their part, so later on in the cafeteria, we are all gonna need to- 
"
20,5,Garrison," Okay children, let's take our seats! Let's uh, get back to our lessons on grammar, shall we?
"
20,5,Stan,"Mr. Garrison?
"
20,5,Garrison,"Okay, does anybody, uh, remember where we left off? No? Alright, uh, who can tell me what an adjective is?  You can go now, I'm back.  Who can t-who can tell me what an adjective is?
"
20,5,Tolkien,"Uh, aren't you running for President?
"
20,5,Garrison,"Adjectives usually come before what? They come before nouns, that's right.
"
20,5,Chris Christie," Mr. Garrison, you can't just act like nothing happened! You're spiraling out of control, and you have to answer to the people!
"
20,5,Garrison,"I don't know what you're talking about! I am a teacher!  Okay, adjectives describe nouns, and there are several types of them-
"
20,5,Chris Christie,"	Mr. Garrison.
"
20,5,Garrison,"What are some examples of adjectives you can give me for this sentence? Anybody? 
"
20,5,Chris Christie,"	You sold people a line, Mr. Garrison, and you have to make good on it!
"
20,5,Garrison,"The yellow ball. That's a good one. Or we can say ""the slippery ball,"" can't we?
"
20,5,Chris Christie,"Come on. 
"
20,5,Garrison,"What else about the ball? No, please!  What else can we say about the ball, children? No, please! Leave me alone!
"
20,5,Butters,"The bouncy ball?
"
20,5,Garrison," No! No, I'm not going back! Please! They're gonna kill me, children! Please! Help me, children! Help me! 
"
20,5,Gerald,"Okay, come on. Office is upstairs.  Oh, hi honey.
"
20,5,Sheila,"Gerald, you're back from your convention?
"
20,5,Gerald,"Yeah, it went really well. This is uh, my IT guy. Gonna help me get my office computers set back up.
"
20,5,Sheila,"Well, can I make you guys somethin' to eat?
"
20,5,Gerald,"Don't worry about us, hon. Lots of work to do. Love you so much!  Ike, no Internet tonight. We need all the bandwidth we can get. Say hi to Dildo Shwaggins.
"
20,5,Dick,"Hello. 
"
20,5,Dick,"I gotta hand it to you, Gerald. You have a really nice home, nice family.
"
20,5,Gerald,"Yeah? Well now you see I have a lot to lose if they find out who I am.
"
20,5,Dick,"And who is that?
"
20,5,Gerald,"	What?
"
20,5,Dick,"I've studied your work. You're so good at lashing out at the system. Bringing people down off their high horses. Why do you do it?
"
20,5,Gerald,"I told you, it's just funny to me. I do it for the lulz.
"
20,5,Dick,"I don't believe that. I think there's more to Skankhunt. When I was in school, kids teased me. Called me ""midget,"" even though I'm not. My mother was a little person, but she actually married a guy who had gigantism syndrome. She thought, if she was a little person and had a baby with a giant, I would come out normal.  We can't let these Danish pricks take our online lives, Skank. For some of us... it's all we have.
"
20,5,Heidi and Cartman,"Let's come together as a skewl.
"
20,5,Cartman,"We can work together hand in hand to make the whole world understand that
"
20,5,Heidi and Cartman,"We came together as a skewl.
"
20,5,Cartman,"Put our difference aside, feeling hope now feeling pride.
No more fighting, it's time for something new.

"
20,5,Heidi and Cartman,"Let's come together as a skewl.
"
20,5,Heidi,"I really feel like this is the start of something new! We're gonna help Denmark, and Denmark is gonna put an end to trolls.
"
20,5,Cartman,"And then maybe everyone can finally be as happy as we are.
"
20,5,Heidi and Cartman,"Let's come together as a skewl.
"
20,5,Cartman,"Terraform Mars.
"
20,5,Garrison,"Oooooohhh.  Oohh!
"
20,5,Adviser,"He went this way!
"
20,5,Chris Christie,"Get back here! You're acting like an idiot! 
"
20,5,Supporters,"Get him! String him up! We put our faith in you, asshole!
"
20,5,Dick,"Test test 1 2. This is Dildo Shwaggins. We are ready to commence the trashing of Denmark. All trolls report in.

"
20,5,Gerald,"Alright, engaging Twitter... now! Prepare for overreaction on my mark. 3... 2... Mark.
"
20,5,Randy,"	Hey, Mr. Garrison. Come on in, bud. Have a seat, you're not alone.
"
20,5,Garrison,"You, you're not gonna try and lynch me too?
"
20,5,Randy,"No lynchings here, little cowboy. Take a seat.  You wanna share with us what you're goin' through?
"
20,5,Garrison," It's all my fault. I just wanted to get rid of all the immigrants, you know?  I just- I thought we could fuck them all to death, and everyone started listening to me. Next thing I know I actually get the nomination from the Republicans!
"
20,5,Randy,"It's not your fault, little guy.
"
20,5,Garrison,"It is my fault! I told people I could make the country great again, but I didn't have a plan!
"
20,5,Randy,"	Not your fault.
"
20,5,Garrison,"I got caught up in people cheerin' for me, bein' in the media every day. I, I led this entire election down the shitter.
"
20,5,Randy,"You've gotta stop blaming yourself.
"
20,5,Garrison,"Well then, whose fault is it?!
"
20,5,Randy,"Here, catch. 
"
20,5,Member Berry,"Member Lando Calrissian? Member tauntauns? Member? Member feeling safe?
"
20,5,Garrison,"What the fuck is this?
"
20,5,Randy,"That... is why millions of Americans want you to be President. But there's more...
"
20,5,Dick,"It's started! 
"
20,5,Gerald,"Did they pick it up on Yahoo?
"
20,5,Dick,"Don't know, but Google has it as the number one story.
"
20,5,Gerald,"Oh, shit! Go to, go to Huffington!
"
20,5,Bill Keegan,"Millions of people took to the Internet last night after shocking claims were made about the Danish company LEGO and their ties to ISIS.
"
20,5,Gerald,"	Oh yes! This is CNN front page right now.
"
20,5,CNN Anchor,"It now appears the country of Denmark was the victim of a massive troll. The country is still reeling from the LEGO hoax story.
"
20,5,Bill Keegan,"Tom, by the time the hoax was revealed the damage had already been done. Millions of people got on the anti-Denmark bandwagon, and when millions more came in to support Denmark, hundreds of millions more got on the anti-Denmark bandwagon.
"
20,5,Dick,"We did it! We did it! 
"
20,5,Gerald,"Oh, Kyle! Ahh, hey, I didn't think you'd be leaving yet.
"
20,5,Kyle,"I have a fundraiser at school.
"
20,5,Gerald,"	Well, did you see what was all over the Internet? Everyone's ripping on LEGOs.
"
20,5,Kyle,"What?
"
20,5,Gerald,"Yeah, now the whole world is blowing up with Danish jokes. It's hilarious.
"
20,5,Dick,"The Guardian has a bunch of stories up about how the Denmark government isn't responding to even interview requests.
"
20,5,Gerald,"Wow, fuck Denmark, huh Kyle? That's gotta be what just about everyone is thinking now. Fuck Denmark. 
"
20,5,Dane 2,"	Sir, public opinion of Denmark is-a very very shit.
"
20,5,Dane 3,"All our social media pages are-a filled with million and millions of-a horrible comments.
"
20,5,Dane 4,"And our crowd-funding sites are taken over too.
"
20,5,Dane 5,"Everyone is making fun of us like we were goofballs.
"
20,5,Dane 6,"	How could-a this-a happen?
"
20,5,Lennart,"Because that's what trolls DO! I should have known that once they got wind of our little plan, they would start trolling us!
"
20,5,Dane 7,"	So then Denmark isn't funding ISIS?
"
20,5,Lennart,"Of course not!
"
20,5,Dane 1,"	But-a how do we prove that to the rest of-a the world?
"
20,5,Lennart,"We can't respond, it will only make the trolls stronger! Our only choice is to go offline
"
20,5,Dane 5,"You mean we have to quit Twitter?
"
20,5,Lennart,"Everything, you ignoramus! The only way to stop the bleeding is for Denmark to get off social media! Pokkers Du Trold!
"
20,5,Heidi,"Hello.  Buy a Danish to help stop trolling? How come nobody's stopping? Maybe this was a terrible idea.
"
20,5,Cartman,"It was a great idea.  Hey! Hey, buy a Danish for Denmark?
"
20,5,Driver,"Heheh, fuck Denmark
"
20,5,Butters," That's it! I am through with your stupid crap! Every house I've been to just rips on me and and says Denmark is stupid!
"
20,5,Cartman,"What?
"
20,5,Kyle," It's true. Denmark got trolled last night. They left social media.
"
20,5,Heidi,"Then, all of this was... for nothing.
"
20,5,Butters,"I told you fellas! This is what you get for working with a bunch of stupid girls!
"
20,5,Wendy,"	How is this our fault?! At least we actually did the work!
"
20,5,Clyde,"Oh yeah? You guys fucked up all the frosting!
"
20,5,Annie,"You assholes overcooked them! 
"
20,5,Heidi,"Oh no! This was a terrible idea! 
"
20,5,Cartman,"Heidi! 
"
20,5,Heidi,"I'm so stupid!
"
20,5,Cartman,"Don't say that.
"
20,5,Heidi,"Why did I even think I could bring the boys and girls together again?
"
20,5,Cartman,"Because you're smart and funny, that's why. It was a great idea, Heidi.  I think that somehow... trolling is playing a bigger part in this than anyone even realizes.
"
20,5,Randy,"Every great empire reaches a point where going backward can seem more appealing than forward. When the world is changing so fast it makes us yearn for the old ways, when life seemed simpler. But it doesn't mean those old ideas are good for us now. We have to face one hard reality as a country.  The new Star Wars was not as good as everyone thought it was. It may seem fun to go back and recycle the past we loved, but we end up with no sustenance.
"
20,5,Garrison,"I thought you were gonna explain why people want a guy like me to be President.
"
20,5,Randy,"Well, that's important too, I guess, but, it's just a symptom of the same thing. See, when a civilization has become so big it starts to get lazy, then that's  when you get member berries. They're noting new. They date back all the way to the Roman Empire.  Once too many Romans ate the member berries there was no more growth. They rested on their laurels just eating and 'membering all the good stuff.
"
20,5,Garrison,"I think those are just grapes.
"
20,5,Randy,"Thought so too till I zoomed in. 
"
20,5,Member Berries,"Member?
"
20,5,Randy,"You see, we all wanna go back to when we were kids. Simple ideas like a big man to protect us, keep us safe. Instead of a fresh new Star Wars we want the old, just recycled and plopped in our tummies.
"
20,5,Garrison,"	You almost make it sound like J.J. Abrams is responsible for this entire election.
"
20,5,Randy,"Does this look familiar? 
"
20,5,Garrison," Ohh Jeeez.
"
20,5,Dane 2,"Sir! We got a message from overseas. You really should see it.
"
20,5,Lennart,"	A message how? We're completely offline.
"
20,5,Dane 2,"This was sent on VHS. Whoever sent it is-a completely offline too.
"
20,5,Lennart,"	Put it on the screen. 
"
20,5,Cartman,"People of Denmark, we know that you've been the victim of trolling. So have we. Maybe we can help. I'm not sure if you know my girlfriend Heidi but... She's really smart and really funny.
"
20,5,Heidi,"	Stop baby, no I'm not.
"
20,5,Cartman," You are, babe. Stop it.
"
20,5,Lennart,"Who the hell are these people?
"
20,5,Dane 2,"Just listen.
"
20,5,Cartman," Go on, babe, just tell them. Tell them.
"
20,5,Heidi,"I have an idea. I might be able to figure out the source of who trolled you last night.
"
20,5,Lennart,"Get everyone back inside. If this girl really is that smart and funny, we might have another shot here. 
"
20,6,Cartman," Whee!  Hi!  So cool! 
"
20,6,Unnamed characters 1 and 2," Hi!
"
20,6,Unnamed character 3," Hi!
"
20,6,Cartman,"Hi!  Dude, Mars rules.  Mars rules!
"
20,6,Heidi,"What are you thinking about, Babe?
"
20,6,Cartman,"Just thinking about how much we could accomplish if... people weren't so close-minded.
"
20,6,Heidi,"You're worried about him again, aren't you? Your friend, Kyle?
"
20,6,Cartman," He's not a bad person, Heidi.
"
20,6,Heidi,"Then talk to him babe. Tell him what we're doing. Maybe you can get him back.
"
20,6,Cartman,"You're right. You're right, Heidi.
"
20,6,Gerald," Ha ha, yeah. I'm yours, bitch. Ha ha. . Suck it!  How about a dick in your mouth?! There you go! Ha ha, ha ha ha ha.  Aw! 
"
20,6,Trolls,"Hi Skankhunt!
"
20,6,Gerald," Ah!  What are you guys doing here?!
"
20,6,Dick,"We came to celebrate!
"
20,6,PurpleheadedQueeflicker,"Not everyday you troll a whole country.
"
20,6,Anonymous821," We brought some beer. Let's have a trolling party.
"
20,6,PurpleheadedQueeflicker,"We did it!
"
20,6,Dick,"I think if anything, we proved that trolls really can have an effect on the world.
"
20,6,Trolls,"Yeah! Yeah!
"
20,6,Troll 7,"You said it!
"
20,6,SupersexyLisa18,"Thanks to us!
"
20,6,Dick,"And I think on the next one,  we're only gonna get better.
"
20,6,Troll 4,"No doubt about it.
"
20,6,Gerald,"Wh-what are you talking about ""next one""?
"
20,6,Dick,"Skankhunt, we got an entire country to sign off social media and... stop what they were doing. Imagine what effect we can have on the rest of the world?
"
20,6,Anonymous821,"We're like super-trolls who could change anything.
"
20,6,Gerald," Can I talk to you for a second?
"
20,6,Gerald,"Why did you bring them here?!
"
20,6,Dick,"What do you mean? We're all on a team, Skankhunt.
"
20,6,Gerald,"That was a one-time deal so nobody would find out who we are!
"
20,6,Dick,"But you saw what we did when we worked together? Just think what we could do to like the Presidential Election.
"
20,6,Gerald,"The election?! I don't give a shit about the election! You don't troll to be political!
"
20,6,Dick,"Of course it's political!
"
20,6,Gerald,"No, I just do it to laugh, like I did when I was a kid! Don't you just remember being a kid and calling someone a fag for no reason?!
"
20,6,Dick,"I remember being called a fag for no reason.
"
20,6,Gerald,"Right! Like it was just fun, right?! Getting political doesn't do anything for me. I just like remembering when I was a kid. That's it. You need to get those people to go and then you need to go.
"
20,6,Dick,"Okay.  Sure, Skankhunt. Whatever you say. 
"
20,6,Garrison,"Presidential election is only two weeks away. We have to  destroy these things.
"
20,6,Jar Berries,"'Member the Bi-wing fighters? 'Member the Service Droids? I 'member.
"
20,6,Randy," That's much easier said than done. They're resistent to just about everything I tried.
"
20,6,Experiment Berry,"'Member, 'member Mos Eisley? 'Member the Rancor, 'member? 'Member sand people? 'Member the Cantina? 'Member--  My eyes!
"
20,6,Jar Berries,"What's going on now? They're using a torch on him. Oh, are they gonna use a torch on us?!
"
20,6,Experiment Berry,"Ah, Aaaaah!  'Member Bespin? 'Member Wedge? I loved Wedge. 'Member?
"
20,6,Randy,"Uh, there has to be something.
"
20,6,Garrison,"Try the acid.
"
20,6,Experiment Berry,"'Member Mon Mothma? 'Member the rebel transports? 
"
20,6,Jar Berries,"They're trying to destroy us. They are?! Our whole species?! They can't do that?! Yeah they can! 'Member the Death Star blowing up Alderaan? Oo, Alderaan, I 'member.
"
20,6,Experiment Berry," 'Member the Cloud City? 'Member IG-88, the bounty hunter droid? 'member, that was fanta'tic.
"
20,6,Randy,"Damn it!  These things are impossible to get rid of.
"
20,6,Kyle," Yeah.
"
20,6,Cartman," Hey, Broship. You got a minute?
"
20,6,Kyle,"Oh, what do you want now?!
"
20,6,Cartman,"Just a second. Please, Kyle?
"
20,6,Kyle,"Hurry up!
"
20,6,Cartman,"Okay,  come on, Baby.
"
20,6,Kyle,"Ah! Dude, what the fuck?
"
20,6,Cartman,"Kyle Kyle, I know you haven't had a serious girlfriend, but you've stop caring about seeing each other in the bathroom.
"
20,6,Kyle,"I'm going to the bathroom!
"
20,6,Heidi,"Eric really cares about you, Kyle. He feels like he's losing you and he's really upset.
"
20,6,Kyle,"Why?
"
20,6,Cartman," I remember not that long ago, Kyle, when you told me in this very room I believe, that you were going to prove who the troll was no matter what. Do you remember that, Kyle? Where's that Kyle?
"
20,6,Kyle," I have to stay with my group, Cartman.
"
20,6,Cartman," No no, I know. Being in groups is great; you get to gang  up and smash people's stuff, pull up your wiener in the cafeteria.  I wonder what the old Kyle say about this Kyle. I wonder if old Kyle would be pretty disgusted right now by who he's become. Heidi's been working with Denmark now, Kyle. I want to show you what she's done. It's gonna change the way you think.
"
20,6,Gerald,"Ha ha ha. ha. You stupid bitch. God. Fuck you! Nobody cares about your fat, little--  Ah. Oh no, not again!  Yes?
"
20,6,Dick,"Hey, Skankhunt, it's Dildo Shwaggins.
"
20,6,Gerald,"I told you to stop FaceTiming me while I'm on the computer. It's very distracting.
"
20,6,Dick,"Well you haven't been answering my calls, so I know this is the only way I can only talk to my buddy.
"
20,6,Gerald,"I'm trying to just use the Internet! People should be able to use the Internet without being harassed.
"
20,6,Dick," Oh, alright. Look,  I wrote a song about our friendship. Can I just play it for you?
"
20,6,Gerald,"No!
"
20,6,Dick," Two lone wolves on the plains of darkness. The Valkyrie  flies from the wailing clouds. The last of the--
"
20,6,Gerald," Bye! Jesus, what is wrong with people?!  Huh.  Nobody cares about your fat sister with Lyme Disease, skank.
"
20,6,Heidi,"'' This is gonna seem a little weird to you, okay?
"
20,6,Kyle,"What is?
"
20,6,Heidi,"Before I quit Twitter and threw my phone away, I was trying to prove who our school message board troll was.
"
20,6,Cartman,"Like you said what you would do, Kyle, except she actually meant it.
"
20,6,Heidi,"Before I stopped searching, I learned something.  Take a look.
"
20,6,Kyle,"What is all this?
"
20,6,Heidi,"To try and prove who the troll was, I started to for patterns in how students used emojis; then I crossed-referenced that with the troll's writing. I call it ""emoji analysis"". People can hide behind a fake name, but the way they use emojis gives them away.
"
20,6,Kyle,"Wow, that's pretty smart.
"
20,6,Cartman,"She's funny too, Kyle.
"
20,6,Heidi,"After I had eliminated nearly every student, I have started to realize that the troll's emojis were more archaic and less elegant than the average kid's. That's when I realized it; whoever Skankhunt42 is on the school message boards, it isn't a student, it's an adult.
"
20,6,Kyle,"You mean like one of the teachers?
"
20,6,Heidi,"I think... it's one of the parents.
"
20,6,Kyle,"Are you sure?
"
20,6,Heidi,"I had enough examples of the teachers' texts and emails to do an emoji analysis, they were much more in lines with Skankhunt's, but still not a match.
"
20,6,Kyle,"Emoji analysis, it's genius!
"
20,6,Cartman,"You're not giving her credit for being hilarious.
"
20,6,Danes," En junker red ved juletid

"
20,6,Dane 8," Sir, take a look at the  statistical analysis. The servers are working.
"
20,6,Bedrager,"So then we don't need any more funding?
"
20,6,Dane 9," No, sir. Using Heidi's emoji analysis, we have the final piece of the puzzle.
"
20,6,Dane 5,"So far we have narrowed down the location of the troll attack on Denmark.  It is a location in the middle of the United States: a place they call ""Colorido"".
"
20,6,Bedrager,"Colorido? That's a very goofy name.
"
20,6,Dane 5,"We believe that very soon the servers will give us the place in Colorido that the troll originated.
"
20,6,Bedrager," Hmm hmm. Go on and hide in your cave, little troll. Soon, everyone will know where you live.
"
20,6,Randy," Damn it!  Nothing kills these things!
"
20,6,Garrison,"We have to keep trying.  Where did they go?
"
20,6,Randy,"They're not in the jar?  That's it. Look, it's over.
"
20,6,Garrison,"No, I'll go find more. 
"
20,6,Randy," It's over! Don't you get it?!  Even if we've found a way to eradicate them now, we don't have time to implement it nation-wide.
"
20,6,Garrison,"Then how do we stop them from getting me elected President?
"
20,6,Randy," There's no other choice, Mr. Garrison.  The American people have to be made to understand what's going on here.  You're gonna have to talk to them.
"
20,6,Garrison," No, no! I am done giving political speeches: I've tried being dirty, I tried being vulgar.  Nothing matters!
"
20,6,Randy," For the first time ever,  you're gonna have to speak from the heart: not make it about you.
"
20,6,Garrison,"Well that's just impossible.
"
20,6,Randy,"You know what these things are capable of. Even if you lose the election, another one like you is gonna rise up and take your place. J.J. Abrams is seeing to that.
"
20,6,Garrison," Don't you get it, Randy? I'm not a politician. I never was.
"
20,6,Randy,"All I know is that for the future of our country, you're gonna have to give one last speech: the speech that everyone needs to hear, a speech where you finally just talk like a normal human being.
"
20,6,Garrison,"Oooh geeeeez!
"
20,6,Cartman,"Hey man, can we have a quick chin wiggle? Look, the other day when you said Heidi wasn't funny, that was pretty lame, man.
"
20,6,Kyle,"She wasn't being funny.
"
20,6,Cartman,"	Oh my God, will you let it go?! Why do you have to have this hangup against women?!
"
20,6,Kyle,"I don't!
"
20,6,Cartman,"	You do, Kyle! You have to think about the things you say! They matter! 
"
20,6,Kyle,"Cartman,  I did some research on the Danish Web site you've been helping out. You do realize that once TrollTrace is online, anybody can use it on anyone, right?
"
20,6,Cartman,"Yeah, to catch trolls.
"
20,6,Kyle,"So somebody, like Heidi, could use it to see your entire Internet history. Everything you ever said and did on the Internet, even before you were together.
"
20,6,Cartman," Well, Heidi doesn't actually use the Internet. We've sworn off that stuff, so it's kewl.
"
20,6,Kyle,"Right, but somebody, like me, could look up your entire Internet history, print it out, and give it to Heidi. I would imagine there's some things you've done or said on the Internet you wouldn't want Heidi to know about.
"
20,6,Cartman," ...Uh oh. 
"
20,6,Liane,"Did you like the movie, hon?
"
20,6,Cartman,"No, it sucked! I'm gonna send Butters an e-mail right now.  ""Dude, don't bother with new Ghostbusters. Totally not funny. Chicks ruined it.""  Can we get ice cream now? I wanna get the taste of ass out of my mouth. 
"
20,6,Cartman,"How can they make what I said on the Internet available to the public? That's bullshit!
"
20,6,Kyle,"It's available to everyone, stupid!
"
20,6,Cartman,"	I gotta go! 
"
20,6,Unknown Memberberries,"Heehee, hurry! Come on, we have to hurry! Let's go.

20,6,Memberberry 1,"Shh.

"
20,6,Gerald,"Oh you got to be--Are you joking?!
"
20,6,Dick,"I don't know how things got derailed but, I-I'm sorry if I made you upset. I want to be buddies again.
"
20,6,Gerald,"Buddies like when? When were we buddies?
"
20,6,Dick,"Come on, let's just have a couple of beers and do some trolling.
"
20,6,Gerald,"I don't have time for you! I'm sorry, dude, but I have a life. I have a wife, and kids,  and shit to do!
"
20,6,Dick,"Why are you mad at me'?
"
20,6,Gerald,"Because you won't go away and let me just have fun!
"
20,6,Dick,"I refuse to believe that Skankhunt is that shallow.
"
20,6,Gerald," Oh here we go!
"
20,6,Dick,"When you Photoshopped penises in Kesha survivors' mouths, it's not just to make people laugh.
"
20,6,Gerald," Yes it is!
"
20,6,Dick,"If someone Photoshopped a dick in your wife's mouth, would you just think it was funny?
"
20,6,Gerald,"You mean my  fucking screensaver.
"
20,6,Dick,"It's true. You're just an asshole. I thought you were the ultimate rebel. I actually looked up to you and you're nothing but a super... dick.
"
20,6,Gerald,"And what are  you, Dildo Shwaggins? Huh? You think you're a fucking political activist hauled up in your shitty little midget condo. You're nothing but a pissed off little giant, lashing out at everyone because you can't get laid!
"
20,6,Dick,"At least I have a reason to be angry. What do you have, that it's funny? Hurting people is just worth the laughs?
"
20,6,Gerald,"Stop trolling me.
"
20,6,Dick,"One day you're gonna wake up and realize that you don't have anyone either.
"
20,6,Gerald,"Stop fucking trolling me.

"
20,6,MLKKK,"Ahhhh! 
"
20,6,Unknown Caller's Daughter,"Is he burning, Pa?!
"
20,6,Unknown Caller,"He's burning bright, little girl.
"
20,6,MLKKK,"Ahhhh! 
"
20,6,Toto," 
It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things...


"
20,6,Memberberry 1,"'Member which way we're going?
"
20,6,Memberberry 2,"I 'member.
"
20,6,Tubbs,"Hey hey, 'member the Ewok village?
"
20,6,Memberberry 3,"Oh I 'member!
"
20,6,Memberberry 1,"I 'member that!
"
20,6,Memberberry 4,"Oh sure, I 'member!
"
20,6,Memberberry 2,"'Member 'member!
"
20,6,Memberry 2,"Oh shit, hang on. 
"
20,6,Memberberry 1,"Hey you, shut the fuck up!
"
20,6,Memberberry 2,"Yeah, we're gonna kill you, 'member?
"
20,6,Mickey,"Oh, I 'member. 
"
20,6,Toto,"It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do

"
20,6,Memberberry 3,"Oh, 'member this song?
"
20,6,Memberberry 4,"Sure, I 'member.

20,6,Memberberry 1,"I love this song, it was fanta'tic, 'member?
"
20,6,Unknown Memberberries,"Oh I 'member. Oh I love it when you 'member! 'Member! 'Member?
"
20,6,News reporter,"Complete panic and mass-hysteria tonight as the City of Fort Collins has been hacked. 
"
20,6,Gerald,"Oh my god. Oh my god, they've done it.
"
20,6,News reporter,"The Danish are taking complete credit for the cyber-attack, blaming its successfully exposed and notorious troll.  The man has been identified as the Internet troll MLKKK,  and was burned alive by one of his apparent victims. 
"
20,6,Gerald,"Ah!
"
20,6,News reporter,"The Danish claimed this was only a beta-test and soon the servers will be available worldwide.  Wait, so like they'll be releasing everyone's Internet history? Uh, I gotta go. 
"
20,6,Gerald,"No! No no no no no!  Dildo, they done it! The Danish figured out how to hack everyone's Internet history!
"
20,6,Dick,"
"
20,6,Gerald,"Ahhh!
"
20,6,Cartman,"Not kewl! Not kewl!  Not kewl! 
"
20,6,Unnamed character 3," Wait!
"
20,6,Unnamed character 1,"Have fun! 
"
20,6,Cartman,"It's all falling apart! Weak!
"
20,6,Heidi,"What is it, Eric? What's wrong?
"
20,6,Cartman,"I-I, I don't know.
"
20,6,Heidi,"Come on. We don't keep secrets, remember?
"
20,6,Cartman,"It's just hard.
"
20,6,Heidi,"You said you wanted to be perfectly honest with me, always.
"
20,6,Cartman,"And I do.  This one time,  I think it was over the summer I went to see the new Ghostbusters movie.
"
20,6,Heidi,"Yeah.
"
20,6,Cartman,"And, and during the movie I was like ""Wait, where is my phone?"" and I couldn't find it; and then Jimmy said ""Ha ha ha, screw you, Cartman,"" and he was holding my phone and he ran off with it and said, ""I gonna send a bunch of texts and emails from your phone so that everyone thinks it's from you,""; and I was like ""No, that's not cool!"" and he said ""Yeah,"" and he said a bunch of mean stuff before I went to go get him and I took my phone back; and I'm just worried th-that people look at my Internet history, they're gonna think all that stuff came from me!
"
20,6,Heidi,"Well I'm glad you told me, 'cause now I know.
"
20,6,Cartman,"So you totally believe me?
"
20,6,Heidi,"Of course.  You've never given me a reason not to believe you, babe.
"
20,6,Cartman (fantasy)," Kewl! 
"
20,6,Heidi,"You have no reason to worry. People will know it wasn't you. With emoji analysis, everyone will be able to tell exactly where any comments came from.
"
20,6,Cartman (fantasy)," Ugh! No,  nooo!
"
20,6,Garrison,"My fellow Americans, we live in an un-presented time of uncertainty. I want to speak to you human-to-human because with God's grace, this will be the last time you ever hear from me. When I started this campaign I was saying a lot of shit because I was angry,  and then I turned that anger into pushing buttons by more and more outrageous. Slowly, people started paying attention to me and I guess it made me feel powerful. Well now the chickens have come home to roost.  Sooner or later, we all get exposed.  We're all held accountable for what we say, what we do.  There is only one thing that matters now. On November eighth, you must vote against me, and show the world that you didn't think the new Star Wars was all that good. When you're in that voting booth, remember that every vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote that shows the world we agree that The Force Awakens was more like a happy day reunion's special than a movie. The choice is yours, America. Please make the right one.
"
20,6,FBI agent 1,"The Danish claim they will soon have the ablity to publish anyone's Internet history. We have to act fast, Mrs. Sandwich.
"
20,6,Clinton,"I'll have you treat me with more respect. Haven't you seen the polls? It's president elects Sandwich.
"
20,6,FBI agent 1,"We may not want to get too far ahead ourselves.  TrollTrace must be stopped. 
"
20,6,Clinton,"Who is Skankhunt42?
"
20,6,FBI agent 1,"We believe he's the only one who can save you now.
"
20,6,Memberberry 1,"Here we are. We made it.
"
20,6,Tubbs,"We did?
"
20,6,Memberberry 2,"Yeah, we have to go with Plan B, 'member?
"
20,6,Memberberry 3,"Ooh, I 'member.
"
20,6,Memberberry 4," Sorry asshole, end of the line for you.
"
20,6,Mickey,"That's okay, I 'member. 
"
20,6,Waiter," Here you are, ma'am, gin and tonic.
"
20,6,Caitlyn," Thanks.
"
20,6,Waiter,"Should be an interesting election this year, huh?
"
20,6,Caitlyn," Buckle up, buckaroos.
"
20,7,Bill Keegan,"And uh, definitely a bit of a surprise here. Looks like America has voted for a change of pace. The world is in a bit of a shock, uh... Is this? We're, we're for sure this is for real, right?
"
20,7,Randy,"What have you done?! You maniacs! 
"
20,7,Bill Keegan,"We uh... I guess we're going live to the acceptance speech now? Uhh okay, here we go.
"
20,7,President Elect Douche," The people have spoken. Just as J.J. Abrams did with Star Wars, I will make this country great again.
"
20,7,Randy,"This isn't how it was supposed to happen.
"
20,7,President Elect Douche,"All my efforts this past week have paid off. And now, let's begin... fucking them all to death!
"
20,7,Cartman,"Hey hey Butters, can I talk to you?
"
20,7,Butters,"What do you want?!
"
20,7,Cartman," Do you remember an e-mail I sent to you a few months ago, after I saw the new Ghostbusters movie? In which I might have said something to the effect of it totally sucking balls because women aren't funny?
"
20,7,Butters,"Well I don't know, Eric.
"
20,7,Cartman,"I just need to see exactly what I e-mailed you, Butters. And then I need you to e-mail me saying what an awesome prank that was e-mailing you ""Ghostbusters sucked balls"" when actually I told you it was really funny several times in person.
"
20,7,Butters," NO! I'm not doing anything for you! You're a traitor!
"
20,7,Cartman,"A traitor?
"
20,7,Butters,"Yeah! Boys and girls were at war, but you go and kiss your little girlfriend's ass! Whatever happened to sticking with your kind?!
"
20,7,Cartman,"Sticking with my kind? You guys broke all my stuff!
"
20,7,Butters,"Because girls drove us to break all your stuff, dumbass! If anyone should be pissed at chicks, it should be you! But no, you got your bitchy little girlfriend pullin' your strings now!
"
20,7,Cartman,"Please do not call her that, Butters. I really like her.


"
20,7,Butters," Oh God, listen to you!  ""Please don't call her that I really like her."" You've changed, Eric! You've really changed! Now get the fuck out of my house! 
"
20,7,Tom,"A historic election, and all the votes are in. Except of course in the city of Fort Collins, Colorado. It's been several days now since Fort Collins was hacked. Everyone's e-mails and Internet history became accessible to the public after being targeted by the Danish Trolltrace program. According to our eye in the sky, their votes will not be tallied anytime soon.
"
20,7,Eye in the sky,"It's complete bedlam inside the city limits, Chris.  Since the city was hacked there have been murder, suicide, and complete lack of civility. We also understand that nearly everyone within Fort Collins who was married is now divorced. Back to you, Tom.
"
20,7,Tom,"This barricade behind me was put up not only to make sure nobody goes into Fort Collins, but also to make sure nobody gets out, since there's no telling whose Internet histories they've seen
"
20,7,Dangling Man," Please!  My wife is so pissed at me!  Guh!
"
20,7,Tom," The defiant Danish company is still declaring Trolltrace a success, and claims that it will be available worldwide at any moment.
"
20,7,Gerald,"Oh God...  Oh God! 
"
20,7,Lead agent,"We have him. The subject is home. 
"
20,7,Kyle,"Dad, what the?
"
20,7,Ike,"What's goin' on, Dad? 
"
20,7,Gerald," They're coming for me, Sheila! They know everything!
"
20,7,Sheila,"About what??
"
20,7,Gerald,"Everything I did online! It's over!
"
20,7,Lead agent,"Sir, if you'll come with us?
"
20,7,Agent 2,"We need to speak with you?
"
20,7,Sheila," You people really have nothing better to do?! What he did online is his business! Or maybe it's me. Maybe I'm the one that likes being peed on and I sucked him into it. Did you know that urine is 100% sterile?! How dare you burst into our home! 
"
20,7,Gerald,"Sheila!
"
20,7,Sheila,"Urologia has been around since the time of the Greeks!
"
20,7,Agent 2,"Sir. Please come with us now. 
"
20,7,Sheila,"Gerald, you don't have to listen to them.
"
20,7,Gerald,"I'm sorry, Sheila. Please know that I love you so much. Goodbye Kyle, Ike. 
"
20,7,Heidi,"I can't believe it, babe. I really didn't think things would end up like this.
"
20,7,Cartman,"Yeah. Neither did I.
"
20,7,Heidi,"I just... feel so disconnected from the world, you know? I really thought this was gonna be the moment that proved girls could do anything, like you always say.
"
20,7,Cartman,"You can't stop believing that. Now more than ever you have to stay strong.
"
20,7,Heidi,"I'm just glad I have you. At least I know you believe girls are smart.
"
20,7,Cartman,"You are smart, Heidi.
"
20,7,Heidi,"And funny too, right? You're always saying how people need to get over that girls are funny.
"
20,7,Cartman," You're funny. Oh my God, when Amy Schumer talks about her vagina I seriously lose my shit.
"
20,7,Heidi,"Hey, are you okay? This election really got to you too, huh?
"
20,7,Cartman,"Yes, Heidi. For the first time I'm really scared for the future.
"
20,7,Heidi,"Me too, babe.  Me too.
"
20,7,Gerald,"Where are you taking me?  Wait! Please, there's been a mistake! Someone set me up! I'm not Skankhunt42!  Dildo?
"
20,7,Hillary Clinton," Hello. Mr. Cunt.
"
20,7,Gerald,"Turd Sandwich... I don't understand.
"
20,7,Hillary Clinton,"Things... have not turned out the way they were supposed to. This election was stolen. And while this government is still in power, we have to prove it. We've come to ask for your help.
"
20,7,Gerald,"My help?
"
20,7,Hillary Clinton,"Leave us.  As I understand, there's quite a lot you've done online you don't wanna have come out. But I also understand you weren't trying to get a woman to kill herself. You were just being funny.
"
20,7,Gerald,"Exactly!
"
20,7,Hillary Clinton,"The Trolltrace program is the most sophisticated of its kind. The government has only a few short weeks to try and use that technology to stop the President-elect from taking office.
"
20,7,Gerald,"What do you want me to do?
"
20,7,Hillary Clinton,"You've proven one thing: that you have the ability to pretend to be someone you're not. We wanna send someone into Denmark undercover and steal their technology.
"
20,7,Gerald,"You mean like... like James Bond? 
"
20,7,Hillary Clinton,"Totally like James Bond. You and I need each other, Skank. What do you say?
"
20,7,Randy,"Garrison! Garrison, what the fuck have you done?!  Where is he?!
"
20,7,Caitlyn,"He's resting. He's had a busy week.
"
20,7,Randy," Yeah I'll say he has!  Do you have any idea what you've done to our country?!
"
20,7,Garrison,"Yeah. Fuck them all.
"
20,7,Randy,"You admitted you didn't know how to run a country! You agree people were supporting you just because they like the new Star Wars, and you begged me to help you lose!
"
20,7,Garrison,"I changed my mind. The new Star Wars was actually really good.
"
20,7,Randy,"No it wasn't!! Something else has to have happened!!
"
20,7,Caitlyn,"Maybe some people enjoy nostalgia and going back to what feels comfortable.
"
20,7,Randy,"There's nothing great about rehashing all the old Star Wars moments into a new-  Ah! Aaah! Aaaaaah!  Aaah.  I, I suppose... I suppose I can watch it one more time. Give it another chance.
"
20,7,Agent 2," You're flying to Denmark under the guise of being a foreign ambassador. The Danish think you want to help them. Here's your fake passport and here are your nifty camera glasses. 
"
20,7,Gerald,"Wow...
"
20,7,Agent 3,"Once inside the Trolltrace building, you will plant this.  Looks like an ordinary briefcase, but at exactly 9:30 Danish standard time. the case will open, detonating an EMP device that will take out their entire facility.
"
20,7,Agent 2,"It'll fry all their equipment, servers, and backup computers. After it detonates we'll be on the roof to pick you up.
"
20,7,Gerald," And then everything can go back to normal.
"
20,7,Lead agent,"One last thing: to pass yourself off as the ambassador, you have to pretend to be from the Turkish Islands. Are you any good at... changing your voice?
"
20,7,Gerald,"That depends. Are you asking me? Or are you asking...  me, Andy the drunk sheriff? *hic*  Or me, the old Irish dart player?  Or me, from Family Guy?  Or me, from Family Guy?  Or me, from Family Guy? 
"
20,7,Gerald,"Hi Ike, it's Daddy. Everything OK there?  Listen, buddy, you remember how we talked about trolling and just between us guys we agreed it was pretty funny?  Well it turns out that even the-
"
20,7,Kyle,"Dad!  Where are you?
"
20,7,Gerald,"Oh, hey Kyle.
"
20,7,Kyle,"Dad, what's going on? Mom is freaking out.
"
20,7,Gerald,"Tell your mom everything's fine, okay? I'm helping out the government. It's top-secret stuff, but everything's finally gonna be okay.
"
20,7,Kyle,"No, Dad, I need you back home. Please, I-I'm so confused right now.
"
20,7,Gerald,"Kyle, you've gotta lighten the fuck up, buddy. Every day with you it's ""Dad, I feel guilty about this. Dad, I'm so confused about that."" You're a kid. You're supposed to just laugh and make fun of shit.  Stop being such a pussy, okay pal? Fuck. 
"
20,7,Ike,"Daddy called you a pussy.
"
20,7,PC Principal,"Alright everyone, listen up. I know that many of us were shocked to the core with last night's election. But we cannot allow our school to be any further divided. It is time to try and start the healing process, and so here, to try and help us heal, is Bill Clinton. 
"
20,7,Bill Clinton,"Hi kids. I'm Bill Clinton, and I was almost the first gentleman in America. Thank you. Even though we might have lost the election, it doesn't mean that my work to be a gentleman is goin' to stop. I'm gonna ask all you boys to agree to join Bill Clinton's Gentleman Club.  But I can't do it alone. Sometimes, I wish there were two of me. Oh wait, there are. Oh Bill!
"
20,7,Bill Cosby,"Yes, Bill?
"
20,7,Bill Clinton,"Come on out here.
"
20,7,Bill Cosby,"Hello, boys and girls.
"
20,7,Bill Clinton,"I'm Bill
"
20,7,Bill Cosby,"And I'm Bill
"
20,7,Bill & Bill,"And together we're Bill and Bill
Two birds of a feather comin' to your school
Gonna show you all about what gentlemen do.
When you're not quite sure how you feel
Ask Bill and Bill.

"
20,7,Bill Clinton,"Say, Bill?
"
20,7,Bill Cosby,"Yes, Bill?
"
20,7,Bill Clinton,"Would you like to join my gentlemen's club?
"
20,7,Bill Cosby,"You know I would, Bill.
"
20,7,Cartman,"Heidi? Heidi!
"
20,7,Heidi,"Hey babe. What's the matter?
"
20,7,Cartman,"Sorry, I have to talk to you. It's really important.
"
20,7,Heidi,"Okay.
"
20,7,Cartman,"Heidi, we... have to get to Mars.
"
20,7,Heidi,"I know, babe. You've talked about how humankind needs to get to Mars for a few weeks now.
"
20,7,Cartman,"No, Heidi, we have to get to Mars like, now.  I've seen what's gonna happen when Trolltrace goes online. I think... a lot of people have said and done things online that will make a lot of other people angry and, it's going to be very bad. Humankind is going to destroy itself and its only hope are the people who go to Mars, where there's no wifi. So nobody can see what anybody said or did on the Internet, ever.
"
20,7,Heidi,"Babe, there's no way to get to Mars right now.
"
20,7,Cartman,"Yes.  Heidi, I think there is. But you have to totally trust me, and know that I'm doing this to save... us.
"
20,7,Heidi,"I trust you with everything I have.
"
20,7,Cartman,"That's kewl.
"
20,7,Ticket agent,"Your name, please?
"
20,7,Gerald,"Miller. Von Miller.  I'm the ambassador of technology from the Turkish Islands.
"
20,7,Ticket agent,"Oh yes of course, Ambassador Miller. You're here to support our country's-a Trolltrace program, yes?
"
20,7,Gerald,"That's right.
"
20,7,Ticket agent,"Your escort is-a right over there. 
"
20,7,Gerald,"Nice little country you have here. Really clean.
"
20,7,Dane 5,"Yes, ambassador. Denmark is ranked the nicest place to live in all the world almost every year.  This is it, ambassador. All of Trolltrace is housed in this building.
"
20,7,Gerald,"Mhm.  Wow, this is really impressive. 
"
20,7,Lennart Bedrager," Thank you for coming.  Welcome to Trolltrace. I cannot tell you how much I've been looking forward to your visit,  Ambassador Von Miller. We have so much to talk about. Won't you join me upstairs for frikadellers and leverpostejs?
"
20,7,Stan,"I can't imagine how you're feeling right now. I know that the election didn't go the way you'd hoped. What I want to say is, I'm sorry.  I know that girls have gone through a lot lately, and I just want you to know that... I'm here for you.
"
20,7,Bill Clinton,"Okay, okay, that's good, but now, make sure she knows how you're gonna change.
"
20,7,Stan,"I am gonna change. I, I am.
"
20,7,Bill Clinton,"Whether she takes you back or not.
"
20,7,Stan,"Yeah well, but I, but I want her to take me back.
"
20,7,Bill Cosby," Yeah, but if you're just changin' to get her back, then you're bein' selfish again.
"
20,7,Stan,"Okay, look. The bottom line is, you still have to have faith... in boys, because... because I miss you, Wendy. 
"
20,7,Butters,"Traitor!  Fuck you, Stan! You're a traitor! 
"
20,7,Stan,"Go away Butters! 
"
20,7,Bill Clinton,"Who's that?
"
20,7,Butters,"How dare you be ashamed of who you are?! 
"
20,7,Bill Cosby,"Oh, he's pressin' pickle!
"
20,7,Lennart,"Enjoying the frikadellers?
"
20,7,Gerald,"Oh. Yes, they're nice.
"
20,7,Lennart,"And the leverpostejs are seasoned to your liking?
"
20,7,Gerald,"Ah, I wouldn't know. Ha, haha.
"
20,7,Lennart,"You keep-a checking your watch, Ambassador Von Miller. Are you late for something?
"
20,7,Gerald,"No, no I, I-I'm just anxious to get a look at your servers. They must be quite impressive.
"
20,7,Lennart,"Yes. Well a database that can identify everybody's Internet activity is-a very complex. I'm so pleased you want to help us rid the world of-a trolls. Do you happen to recognize...  this woman?
"
20,7,Gerald,"Ahhh... no.
"
20,7,Lennart,"Her name was-a Freja Ollegard. She was Denmark's-a national treasure.  She had an amazing breast-cancer awareness website, and some... troll... decided to Photoshop-a wieners in her mouth. 
"
20,7,Gerald,"Oh, wow. That's terrible.
"
20,7,Lennart,"Her final straw was when she was trolled on a live TV show.  When the troll posted comments about-a breast cancer with-a fake doctors' names. Would you like to know what the doctors' names were? The first one was a Dr. Boobsoff. Dr. Cootsier Boobsoff.  Then I believe there was a Dr. Juerdior Titsgo.  But probably most insensitive of all was when the troll said he was Dr. Ipples. Dr. Now I'm Only-n Ipples.  Are you alright, Von Miller?!
"
20,7,Gerald,"I'm fine. I... I think the frikadellers gave me a little heartburn. Ah, if you wouldn't mind, could I see the servers now?
"
20,7,Lennart,"It would be my pleasure.
"
20,7,Bill Clinton,"Hello, I'm Bill Clinton, and I was almost the First Gentleman in America.
"
20,7,Stephen,"Oh my gosh! Honey, it's the nearly-Gentleman!
"
20,7,Bill Clinton,"May I come into your lovely home?
"
20,7,Stephen,"Well of course, that's very gentlemanly of you. 
"
20,7,Linda,"Oh my goodness, it's him. Hello, sir.
"
20,7,Bill Clinton,"Hello, ma'am. I wasn't expecting someone so stunning.  I'm so sorry for the intrusion, but I was wondering if I could speak with your son.
"
20,7,Stephen,"Oh. Well, I'm afraid Butters is grounded for pressing pickle at the nail salon again.
"
20,7,Linda,"Stephen, this is a guest, a gentleman.
"
20,7,Stephen,"Uh but, but of course we'll make an exception.  Butters has been grounded quite a lot lately. Don't know what's gotten into him. 
"
20,7,Bill Clinton,"Well, maybe I can help.
"
20,7,Stephen,"That'd be great. No matter how hard we ground him, he remains defiant.  Butters, stop smooshing snake! The gentleman is here to speak with you.
"
20,7,Butters," What?
"
20,7,Bill Clinton,"Hello, young man. Come on, sit down. Let's talk.
"
20,7,Randy,"Well, I don't know about you guys, but I sure am excited. America is going to be great again. Aren't you excited, gang?
"
20,7,Shelly,"No I'm not excited! It sucks, Dad! This country is gonna suck for four years!
"
20,7,Randy,"Aww, come on, Shelly. We've learned that women can be anything. Except for President.
"
20,7,Sharon,"Randy! You just spent the last month convincing me that the only reason people wanted to go back was because of a childish nostalgia they all had for the new Star Wars!
"
20,7,Randy,"Have you really watched it, Sharon? It has more to offer than just nostalgia. Let's all watch it again tonight.
"
20,7,Sharon,"What?! I don't wanna watch Star Wars any more than I- 
"
20,7,Shelly,"Dad, what the hell is wrong with y- 
"
20,7,Lennart,"Please, ambassador, explore the servers at your leisure. Let us know if you have any questions.
"
20,7,Gerald,"Thank you. 
"
20,7,Dick,"You can stop being an idiot now.
"
20,7,Gerald," What the-? Dildo?
"
20,7,Dick,"Skankhunt.
"
20,7,Gerald,"What the fuck are you doing here?
"
20,7,Dick,"I was sent here by the government to do international espionage like James Bond.
"
20,7,Gerald,"Nononononono, that's what I'm doing. Hillary Clinton says I was the only one capable of-
"
20,7,Dick,"Of being smart and funny enough to pull it off. Yeah, that's what she told all of us.
"
20,7,Gerald,"All of us? Who? 
"
20,7,Anonymous 821,"Hey Skankhunt.
"
20,7,Gerald,"What the hell is going on?
"
20,7,Dick,"Don't you get it? The government made some kind of deal with the Danish. They handed us over so they wouldn't go forward with their Trolltrace program. They wanted the troll who killed Freja Ollegard and his associates. We got sold out because of you!
"
20,7,Gerald,"No!  No, you've got to let me out of here! I'm not one of them! 
"
20,7,Anonymous 821," Hey look, it's 9:30. The briefcases are about to go off. 
"
20,7,Bill Clinton,"What do you think you're gonna achieve, young man? Do you really think all this pickle-pressing is gonna get you anywhere?
"
20,7,Butters,"Well, I'm just angry, Mr. Gentleman. I'm tired of girls saying boys need to change. Somebody has to stand up for our rights!
"
20,7,Bill Clinton,"What happened, son? Did a girl break your heart?
"
20,7,Butters," No.
"
20,7,Bill Clinton,"I know. I know how hard they can be. But... somethin's about to happen that you aren't aware of.  You see, Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. And trust me, my wife is a crazy bitch. She and all the other women in the world are about to get payback. And we are all completely fucked. It's my fault, really. I've done things my whole life that gradually broke her spirit. And now that she's lost everything, let me assure you: she is piiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiissed.  Now, our only chance is to keep our heads low and act like we're changed men. Because, we're very close to the end.
"
20,7,Butters,"The end? Of what?
"
20,7,Bill Clinton,"Women are sick of our shit, son. And soon, they're gonna know everything we've said and done online. And unless we start kissin' their asses, we're all gonna be put in a big chamber underground and milked for our semen.
"
20,7,Heidi,"Eric, we're so far from home.
"
20,7,Cartman,"We aren't gonna see home again, babe. We're gonna make it. There's no turning back.
"
20,7,Heidi,"You really think there's hope?
"
20,7,Cartman,"Yes. I do. 
"
20,8,Government agent,"The political world is watching, Bannon.  We need to make sure the president elect has a smooth transition.
"
20,8,Bannon,"All indications are that his transition  is going to be fine.
"
20,8,Surgeon," We're just doing some finishing touches, but everything went well. You can see him now if you like.
"
20,8,Caitlyn,"I'll go.
"
20,8,Garrison," Well, do I look presidential?
"
20,8,Caitlyn,"Honestly, you look twenty years younger.
"
20,8,Garrison,"They really worked on my stank face. Look! Whenever I don't know what people are talking about, I just do this,  like look.  I can do this.  This is, this is my stank face.  It's like, I'm not listening to you, see?  They did a really good job on my stank lips.
"
20,8,Caitlyn,"It's an amazing transition.
"
20,8,Garrison,"Now I feel ready to take care of business and do what really matters...  in just a minute, I'm gonna do the UV rays a bit longer.
"
20,8,,"
"
20,8,Secretary,"Can I help you?
"
20,8,Cartman,"Hello. I understand that you're trying to get to Mars. This is my girlfriend, Heidi. She's really smart and really funny.
"
20,8,Secretary,"...Okay.
"
20,8,Cartman,"We've given up social media and we'd like to be somewhere as far from the internet as possible. Is it true Mars would have really shitty Wi-Fi?
"
20,8,Secretary,"...That'd be an understatement, yes.
"
20,8,Cartman,"Well, we'd like to go. We can't tolerate this world anymore and we'd like to talk to whoever we can about getting to Mars as soon as possible please.
"
20,8,Secretary,"Uh-huh. Take a number and join the others.
"
20,8,Cartman,"What others?
"
20,8,,"
"
20,8,Cher," If I could turn back time...
"
20,8,Cartman,"What the fuck, dude?!
"
20,8,Secretary,"Lot of people want to leave the planet right now.
"
20,8,Cartman,"Ah god dammit, is that Cher?!
"
20,8,Cher," Do you believe in leaving the world, oh...
"
20,8,PC Principal,"God  dammit!  How the fuck did this happen?!
"
20,8,Mackey," Uh, sorry PC Principal, but someone wants to speak with you.
"
20,8,PC Principal,"I told you to leave me alone, Mackey!  I'm not in the mood!
"
20,8,Mackey,"But, but sir, the president elect is here. 
"
20,8,Garrison," So sorry for the intrusion. You're not too busy, I hope.
"
20,8,PC Principal,"Uh, not at all. Please uh, have a seat, Mr. Garrison.
"
20,8,Garrison,"Excuse me?
"
20,8,PC Principal,"Uh, please have a seat, Mr... President.
"
20,8,Garrison,"That's better, bitch. 
"
20,8,PC Principal,"Certainly want to uh, congratulate you on the election.
"
20,8,Garrison,"Do you remember the day you fired me, PC Principal?
"
20,8,PC Principal,"I know we've had some differences, uh...
"
20,8,Garrison,"I was upset because a bunch of immigrants were changing my class and I believe your response was that I needed to go and ""learn their language"", ""be more open-minded"".
"
20,8,PC Principal,"I'm sorry that your position here at the school was terminated.
"
20,8,Garrison,"Are you really?  Are you really sorry?  Because you see PC Principal, you helped create me. You insisted that I was a bigot, that I was an intolerant relic left over from another time. But now, I'm your president. And if there's one thing I've learned about becoming president, it's that your penis can get really dry. When all the skin on your penis is drying out from working so hard to get elected there's only one thing that can fix it, isn't there? Saliva, from a good friend who once doubted you. I need you to fix my problem, PC Principal, so that we can be even-stevens. What do you say, bud?
"
20,8,PC Principal,"
"
20,8,Unknown berries,"Oh, 'member when it fell in her drink. Yeah, I 'member.
"
20,8,Memberberry 1,"'Member when Han shot Greedo?

"
20,8,Don,"Ah sure, I 'member.
"
20,8,Memberberry 4,"We did the thing with throwing Mickey in the drink, 'member?!
"
20,8,Don,"Ah sure, I 'member; just 'cause of youse, we won the election.
"
20,8,Tubbs,"Yeah yeah, 'member?
"
20,8,Don,"Waiter, round of drinks for our heroes here, 'member?
"
20,8,Waiter Berry,"I 'member.
"
20,8,Don,"You done good poisoning the lady's drink. Now our man is in office, 'member? But I still have things I need you to do.
"
20,8,Tubbs,"Hehe, hehe, I 'member.
"
20,8,Gerald,"Please, you have to let me outta here!
"
20,8,Dick,"Skankhunt, stop!
"
20,8,Bedrager," Yes, please. You're making a very jackass of-a yourself.
"
20,8,Gerald,"
"
20,8,Bedrager,"Well well, what do we have here? Looks like your little troll-party.
"
20,8,Troll 4,"You Danish pricks, you tricked us!
"
20,8,Bedrager,"We didn't trick you, your own government did. They thought if they handed you over to us we would agree not to go forward with the TrollTrace program.
"
20,8,Gerald,"You can't hold people prisoner! I haven't done anything! People are gonna be looking for me!
"
20,8,Bedrager," By all means,  contact whoever you want. Of course, you'll have to tell them why you're here.
"
20,8,Dick,"What are you gonna do with us?
"
20,8,Bedrager,"We're going to use you to set the world on fire. When the servers go online, there will be chaos, panic, and war. And from the ashes, a new world will rise: a world where everyone is happy, and singing, and has no secrets,  like Denmark! 
"
20,8,Dick,"You think you can turn countries in the world against each other? Our president will never let that happen.
"
20,8,Garrison,"Hey everybody!  Guess who's here? It's the President of the United Fucking States.  Oh, it's been a while since I've heard from you guys. Hi, Janice.  Hello, Stephen.
"
20,8,Stephen," Mr. President.
"
20,8,Garrison," I was just, you know, passing through the old neighborhood  thinking about what laws I might get rid of, when suddenly, out of nowhere, my penis got really dry. You know if they have anything at this store for a dry dick? Huh? No? You guys can't think of anything? Oh, I know. What about  Eduardo Hernandez? I believe it was Eduardo who told me I couldn't double-bag my groceries, even though he's from fucking Guatemala. Well, what do you think now, Eduardo? You wanna double-bag somethin' else?  This is the President.
"
20,8,First general,"Sir, we need you at the Pentagon. It's a matter of national security.
"
20,8,Garrison,"Oh, really? I'm kinda busy right now, jeez.
"
20,8,First general,"Sir, the Danish have released a statement. I'm afraid... we may be going to war.
"
20,8,Garrison,"War?
"
20,8,Gerald,"Ike?! Ike, buddy, can you hear me?! I need you to do something, okay? Daddy needs your help! I need you to go to your browser and sign on to the school message board, okay? Can you do that for me? The school message board and then log in. Lowercase S, skank-hunt-4-2. You got it?
"
20,8,Dick,"Wow.
"
20,8,Anonymous821,"Wow, what?
"
20,8,Dick,"He's gonna have his son sign in and troll for him.
"
20,8,Gerald," If Skankhunt is still out there trolling, then they have the wrong guy! Get it?! It's called ""using your brain"", fatso!
"
20,8,Anonymous821,"So they'll blame your kid?
"
20,8,Gerald,"Nobody cares if a kid trolls! What are they gonna do, get a slap on the wrist?
"
20,8,Dick," Didn't you hear what that guy said? They're gonna set countries against each other! We have way bigger problems!
"
20,8,Gerald,"You don't know my fucking wife!  Ike, you got it? Great, pal! Okay, now I need you to go to the comment section, okay, and type in ""You should all get raped by gorillas"". You got that pal? Ike, ""You should all get raped by gorillas""! Come on, we have a lot of work to do here!
"
20,8,Cartman,"Jesus, I didn't think getting to Mars would take this long.
"
20,8,Heidi,"You really think this is what we should do, babe? I gonna miss everyone.
"
20,8,Cartman,"I know, but it'll be worth it, babe. We'll be left alone to make our new world better.
"
20,8,Butters,"Hey, Eric! 
"
20,8,Cartman," What the hell are you doing here?
"
20,8,Butters,"Well I want to get the fuck off this planet, but they told me I had to take a number.
"
20,8,Cartman,"Oh no no no! You're a male chauvinist sexist pig, Butters. You don't get to go to Mars.
"
20,8,Butters," No, you don't understand. I've seen the light, I'm a changed man, I thought boys were being treated unfairly, but now I know... shit's about to get a lot worse.
"
20,8,Memberberries,"'Member The Fugitive? '' 'Member Aliens? '' Here we are! Ah, yeah! I 'member. Come on, everybody, 'member? '' 'Member snow speeders? '' Yeah, I 'member! 'Member not hearing? '' 'Member the invasion of Hoth? Haha! 'Member ""you rebel scum""? I 'member! '' Oh, 'member the rebel transports? ''
"
20,8,Memberberry 1,"""We did it!"" 'Member? ''
"
20,8,Memberberry 2,"Sure, I 'member!
"
20,8,Memberberry 3,"What do we do now?
"
20,8,Memberberry 4,"Don't you 'member?
"
20,8,Tubbs,"Ooh, I 'member.
"
20,8,Gerald,"Okay now make sure the little worm is in the woman's mouth, got it?
"
20,8,Ike,"
"
20,8,Gerald,"Now I need you to type ""You're a fat retard"" in the comments.
"
20,8,Ike," ""You're a retard.""
"
20,8,Gerald,"No, you have to say ""a fat retard"", Ike! It's a nuance, but it's very important!
"
20,8,Ike," ""You are a fat retard.""
"
20,8,Sheila," Ike! What are you doing?!
"
20,8,Ike,"What he says.
"
20,8,Gerald,"
"
20,8,Sheila," It was you, all this time! What have you done, Ike?! Do you have any idea the damage you've caused?! How could my child be such a monster?!  Yes yes, hello?!
"
20,8,Gerald," Hey sweetheart, how's everything going?
"
20,8,Sheila,"You have to come home from helping the government, Gerald! I just caught Ike trolling Mrs. Herrera!
"
20,8,Gerald,"Are you serious?
"
20,8,Sheila,"Yes! The school troll is our son, Gerald! You should see all the things he's posted on his computer!
"
20,8,Gerald,"God dang it! Let me talk to him right now!
"
20,8,Shelia,"
"
20,8,Ike,"Hello?
"
20,8,Gerald,"Hey Ike, just stay calm and act like I'm yelling at you, okay pal? Okay, give it a few seconds, wait. Good. Okay, now--now say ""I'm sorry, dad. I guess I'm just fucked up inside"".
"
20,8,Ike,"No!
"
20,8,Gerald,"Ike, you have to listen to me. On your mother's life, this is a matter of national security! You have to say ""I'm sorry, dad. I guess I'm just fucked up inside""!
"
20,8,Ike," I'm sorry dad. I'm just fucked up inside.
"
20,8,Gerald,"That was amazing, kiddo. It'll all be worth it, okay? I'll make this up to you. Give me back to your mom.
"
20,8,Sheila," Gerald?!
"
20,8,Gerald,"He's full of shit, he's not sorry! If he felt sorry, he wouldn't be able to do it in the first place!
"
20,8,Sheila,"I know!
"
20,8,Gerald,"I'm gonna get home as soon as I can to deal with this, okay? We can deal with this together. Just don't say anything to anyone for now, all right?
"
20,8,Sheila,"Okay. Okay yeah, I love you too. I know. Bye.  You just sit in here until we figure out what to do; and if you get back on that computer, you are done, you got it?! 
"
20,8,Gerald," Ike! Okay there's just a few more things I need you to do. I need you to type ""How'd you like a donkey dick?"".
"
20,8,First general," Welcome to the Pentagon, sir. I've been ordered to show you around.  This way, please.
"
20,8,Garrison," So I can do whatever the fuck I want in here now, right?
"
20,8,First general,"Yes, sir. Here are all  our military secrets and all classified information.
"
20,8,Garrison," Okay, good.
"
20,8,First general," This is the Drone Program. In there you can kill anyone on Earth remotely. Here's the keys. 
"
20,8,Garrison,"Thanks!
"
20,8,,"
"
20,8,First general,"In here is satellite surveillance where you can monitor anyone's conversation live.
"
20,8,Garrison,"Oh that will come in handy.
"
20,8,First general,"Extreme interrogation  room in case you find interrogation necessary.
"
20,8,Garrison,"Oh hell yeah, it's necessary. Let's do it.
"
20,8,First general," And here of course is the famous ""football"", where you could order a nuclear attack in four minutes. 
"
20,8,Garrison,"Love me some football. 
"
20,8,First general," And finally, in here, is the diplomatic strategy and negotiating room. 
"
20,8,Garrison,"Well, jeez, this doesn't look very fun.
"
20,8,Second general,"Thank God you're here sir. We need your guidance.
"
20,8,Butters,"Loolooloo, I've got some apples. Loolooloo, you've got some too.
"
20,8,Cartman,"Butter, Butters! You expect people to believe that you went from being the biggest asshole in the school to a softhearted feminist like me? Fat chance.
"
20,8,Butters,"No no, believe me. I'm a changed man. Girls are really smart, and they'll be running the country soon, and they deserve total respect.
"
20,8,Cartman,"Yeah? You just forgot one thing, that women are funny too. That didn't occur to you, did it, Butters?
"
20,8,Butters,"Well I don't think there was ever any question women are funny. Remember that movie 9 to 5 with Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton?
"
20,8,Heidi,"Oh yeah, that movie was funny.
"
20,8,Butters,"Well I laughed my butt off and it never even occurred to me that they were women. I don't know why things changed. I don't know why people make such a big deal about women and comedy now. I mean what about Carol Burnett? She was great.
"
20,8,Heidi,"Wow, I guess you're right.
"
20,8,Cartman,"Yeah, I mean, when women make vagina jokes I think it's the funniest thing ever!
"
20,8,Butters,"Yeah, well I swear I don't care how many times Amy Schumer talks about her vagina, I laugh every time.
"
20,8,Cartman," Oh, I see what you're doing.
"
20,8,Heidi,"What, babe?
"
20,8,Cartman,"Oh nothin', babe. I'm just... Do you think you could tell me some jokes?
"
20,8,Heidi," Why do you want me telling you jokes all the time?
"
20,8,Cartman,"Because you're  fucking hilarious.
"
20,8,Heidi,"Well, did I tell you the one about the skeleton and the skunk?
"
20,8,Butters," That's already funny! 
"
20,8,Second general,"All around the world, countries are mobilizing armies and preparing defensive countermeasures.
"
20,8,Garrison,"Why? What the hell happened?
"
20,8,First general,"This is everything you need to know about the TROLL TRACE program.
"
20,8,Garrison,"What's TROLL TRACE?
"
20,8,First general,"A plan by the Danish to release the full internet histories of everyone on Earth.
"
20,8,Second general,"The previous administration tried to work with the Danish by handing over several trolls, but the plan didn't work. 
"
20,8,First general,"The entire world has become very uncertain and unstable.
"
20,8,Second general,"We think we should order all navy vessels to the Bering Sea.
"
20,8,Garrison,"For what?
"
20,8,First general,"Because when the Chinese are able to see all our e-mails and online activity, we believe they will most likely attack us. Also, there are ground troops mobilizing in Paris because the French believe when we see all their e-mails, we will most likely attack them.
"
20,8,Third general,"Mr. President, sir! The Russians are asking what we intend to do about the Danish.
"
20,8,Garrison,"Well, why are you asking me?
"
20,8,Second general,"Please, sir, we have very little time before this escalates beyond our control.
"
20,8,Aide 1,"Президент Путин, Датское утверждает, что они всё ещё готовы включить программу Troll Trase.
"
20,8,Putin,"Это всё, что я сказай, всё, что я сделай на Интернет будет доступно моей подруге?
"
20,8,Aide 1,"Да, кажется так.
"
20,8,Putin,"Датское должно быть оставновлены! Мы нужно знать, как Соединённые Штаты стоят на этом! 
"
20,8,Aide 2,"Э... Господин президент, Овальный кабинет. 
"
20,8,Putin,"Да, это президент Путин.
"
20,8,Memberberry 3,"'Member the Death Star?
"
20,8,Memberberry 1,"Ahahaha, 'member cutting open tauntauns?
"
20,8,Memberberry 4,"Yeah, yeah, 'member the Force? 
"
20,8,Putin,"Что это такое?
"
20,8,Tubbs,"Heheh, heheh, yeah, sure, I 'member.
"
20,8,Memberberry 1,"Member McGy-?
"
20,8,Tubbs,"Sure, I 'member.
"
20,8,Memberberry 3,"'Member?
"
20,8,Memberberry 2,"Heheh, hey hey hey, 'member the Cold War?
"
20,8,Memberberry 1,"Oh I loved the Cold War! That was fantastic!
"
20,8,Tour assistant,"Okay, Numbers 204 through 215, you can come on through.
"
20,8,Cartman," Oh, finally.
"
20,8,Butters,"Hey, that's me too. Yippee!
"
20,8,Tour assistant,"Right in here, everyone. 
"
20,8,Elon Musk,"Hello, everyone, and welcome to the tour. I'm Elon Musk. Are we gonna have some fun today?
"
20,8,Cartman,"Oh great, a stupid tour guide. Can we just talk to someone important please? We want to go to Mars.
"
20,8,Elon Musk,"And getting anywhere takes ingenuity. Oh, Mrs. Door? Would you mind... opening, please?
"
20,8,PA door voice," Yes, Elon. 
"
20,8,Elon Musk,"The only way for humankind to survive is with imagination and technology. Cars that run on electricity. Solar panels that replace roof shingles. Even food that changes form. You see this? It's a pizza, only four inches long. And yet, when heated, it expands to make enough pizza to feed a hundred people. I call it the pizza... pocket.
"
20,8,Cartman," They already have Pizza Pockets.
"
20,8,Elon Musk,"Who would like to see the Hyperloop? A new mode of travel that can take you from here to Dubai in nine minutes.
"
20,8,Cartman,"Excuse me, Mr. Musk, this is all super interesting and shit, but can we see the Mars rocket now?
"
20,8,Staffer 1,"Sir, India is moving aircraft carriers into the Gulf of Mexico.
"
20,8,Garrison,"Well why would we care about Mexicans?!
"
20,8,Staffer 2," Sir, a message from Saudi Arabia. They say they pinky-promise not to look up our Internet history if we pinky-promise not to look up theirs.
"
20,8,Garrison,"Well what does that even mean?!
"
20,8,Staffer 3," Still waiting on if we should send troops into Japan, sir.
"
20,8,Garrison,"I don't know, jeez!
"
20,8,First general,"Sir, it's the UK Secretary of Foreign Affairs calling from London. He says they have advice for you.
"
20,8,Garrison,"What?
"
20,8,Boris Johnson,"Yes, hello? Things aren't looking good here. We just want to say, whatever you do, don't eat the membberries.
"
20,8,UK aide," Don't eat the membberries. They are bad.
"
20,8,Garrison,"Memberries?
"
20,8,Boris Johnson,"I'm afraid everyone here who ate the memberries wanted to go back in the past, you see. Hasn't worked out too well for us.
"
20,8,UK aide,"We shouldn't have ate the memberries!
"
20,8,Boris Johnson,"The memberries cloud your judgement. They get inside your head, you see.
"
20,8,Garrison,"Get inside your head... Wait a minute... Nobody gets in my head, you limey bitch! Are you insulting me?! Stop wasting my time! 'Cause I'll have you here on a plane in five hours suckin' my dick!! 
"
20,8,UK aide,"What'd he say?
"
20,8,Boris Johnson,"I believe they've eaten the memberries.
"
20,8,UK aide,"Ooh, dear!
"
20,8,UK aide 2,"Ooh, dear!
"
20,8,Elon Musk,"Here you see our Falcon 9 full-thrust rockets. They are actually able to take off into space and land safely back on Earth for reuse.  Well, I certainly wanna thank you all for joining our tour today. You've been a wonderful group. Give yourselves a round of applause.
"
20,8,Groups,"Huh?
"
20,8,Cartman,"Whoawhoawhoawhoa, what about going to Mars?
"
20,8,Elon Musk,"Mars? We're still about ten years away from going to Mars. Maybe eight.
"
20,8,Groups,"Awwww.
"
20,8,Cartman,"No, no nonono, we have to go now!
"
20,8,Elon Musk,"Well I'm sorry, but it's a bit more complicated than a pizza pocket. Going to Mars is gonna take a lot of very smart people working very hard for a very long time. Now, if you don't mind, I have hundreds of more tours to do. 
"
20,8,Butters,"Mr. Musk, wait!  Maybe we can help you get to Mars sooner. I'm not sure if you know our friend, Heidi. She's really smart, and really funny. 
"
20,8,Elon Musk,"Like... how funny?
"
20,8,Don,"Out of the way, 'member?
"
20,8,Berry Henchmen,"You'd better 'member if you know what's good for youse! 
"
20,8,Memberberries,"Hey look, it's them. 'Member? Sure, I 'member. 
"
20,8,Don,"Ey, youse did good. Who's in charge, 'member?
"
20,8,Memberberry 3,"We decided he's in charge.
"
20,8,Memberberry 1,"No, we said I'm in charge, 'member?
"
20,8,Memberberry 4,"No wait, I 'member. We all said he's in charge. 
"
20,8,Memberberry 2,"Oh yeah, I 'member.
"
20,8,Don,"Wrong. 
"
20,8,Memberberry 3,"Waaah!
"
20,8,Don,"'Member stormtroopers?
"
20,8,Memberberry 2,"Sure, I 'member.
"
20,8,Don,"Not those stormtroopers! The real old ones. People wanna 'member? They're gonna 'member.
"
20,8,Kyle,"Ike?  What are you doing?
"
20,8,Sheila,"Don't talk to him! He is in big trouble!
"
20,8,Kyle,"Well what'd he do?
"
20,8,Sheila,"It's him, Kyle! Your brother is the internet troll who's caused all this pain in our community!
"
20,8,Kyle,"What?
"
20,8,Sheila,"It was him all along. Now we have to figure out what to tell people when they learn this ugliness came from our family. 
"
20,8,Kyle,"You made people quit Twitter? You started a war between boys and girls? You...?
"
20,8,Heidi,"I call it ""Emoji Analysis"". It isn't a student, it's an adult.
"
20,8,Sheila,"This ugliness came from our family!
"
20,8,Heidi,"I think it's one of the parents.
"
20,8,Gerald,"You're suppose to just laugh and make fun of shit.
"
20,8,Ike,"Daddy called you a pussy.
"
20,8,Kyle," Oh my God. Oh my God! Ike, come on! 
"
20,8,Sheila,"Kyle? Ike?! Whatwhatwhaaat?! 
"
20,9,Harrison,"Everyone calm down, please. We have to have civil order. Listen to me.
"
20,9,,"
"
20,9,Unknown person,"Really?
"
20,9,Harrison,"Now I know everyone's scared, but we have to keep control. Yes all of our emails and Internet histories are about to become public knowledge.
"
20,9,,"
"
20,9,Harrison," But, but,
"
20,9,,"
"
20,9,Harrison,"we all need to understand that TrollTrace will never happen if people don't log on to use it. The website is a massive database that cross-references everything ever said on the Internet. It relies on people typing in a name and address of someone else  to add to that database. If we could all agree to resist the urge to look up other people's Internet histories,  Maggie, okay? As long as we all respect each other's privacy, darling,  then our town won't suffer the same fate as Fort Collins.
"
20,9,Stephen,"And what are the police gonna do to make sure people don't use it?! I know I'll certainly respect others' privacy, but about other people like  Laura Tucker the Blabbermouth?
"
20,9,Laura,"Excuse me?
"
20,9,Harrison,"And that's why we have to come together as a community, and resist any temptation to use TrollTrace,  Maggie. We have to stay in control.  This hack of our city will never happen, so long as we rely on the rationality and the basic decency of the American people.
"
20,9,,"
"
20,9,Harrison,"Guess I could've worded that differently.
"
20,9,Sheila," What were you thinking?! How dare you outright defy me like that! Your brother was being punished for using the computer and you decide to just leave with him?
"
20,9,Kyle,"I just felt bad for him, ma.
"
20,9,Sheila,"You felt bad for him, after all the horrible things he said to people online?! Your brother is a sick troll, Kyle! You just wait until your father gets home. 
"
20,9,Gerald,"Ike, where the fuck have you been?! Daddy needs your help. You don't want Mommy and Daddy to get divorced, do you?  You know how bad your mom is, she completely overreacts to everything. That's where your brother gets it from. You don't want to be like Kyle, do you?
"
20,9,Kyle," Hi dad.
"
20,9,Gerald," Hey, buddy! Everything good there?
"
20,9,Kyle,"It was you, this whole time. You're the troll that caused all of this trouble.
"
20,9,Gerald,"No, it was your brother. I don't know what's wrong with him, Kyle. He needs counseling...
"
20,9,Kyle,"Heidi Turner did an emoji analysis. It was an adult. It was you.
"
20,9,Gerald," Shh, shh. Shh, shh. Okay, keep your voice down.
"
20,9,Kyle," Why dad? Why did you do this?
"
20,9,Gerald,"Because it's fucking funny, Kyle. It's called having a sense of humor, and laughing. You should fucking try it once in a while!
"
20,9,Kyle,"Putting a penis in the mouth of a mom who has cancer is funny?!
"
20,9,Gerald,"Because it's so not funny, God! Pushing people's buttons to get a reaction can actually be very good for society, Kyle. Listen to me, the Danish are fucking crazy. You have to get people to stop them.
"
20,9,Kyle,"How?!
"
20,9,Gerald,"Go get people riled up. Call the President. I don't know. When you push people's buttons, they go and push other people's buttons. Now get out there and... 
"
20,9,Sheila," Kyle, Ike! What the hell is this?! What did I say?! Get off of that computer riiight nooooow!
"
20,9,Ike,"
"
20,9,Secretary,"Uh everyone, please listen! We don't have any rockets going to Mars! Yo-you're not listening! We don't have the energy requirements figured out yet. We're working as hard as we can. There's a little girl working on the people right now and apparently she's incredibly smart and funny.
"
20,9,Cartman," You got it figured out yet, babe?
"
20,9,Heidi," Babe, I have no idea what any of this means.
"
20,9,Cartman,"Heidi, yes you do. You just have to get over yourself. Come on, say it. Say it.
"
20,9,Heidi,"Girls rule, women are funny, get over it.
"
20,9,Cartman," Get over it, baby. Stop holding yourself back.
"
20,9,Heidi,"
"
20,9,Elon Musk,"Uh excuse me. Sorry, can we have a word please?
"
20,9,Cartman," What the fuck do you want?!  Hang on, babe. 
"
20,9,Elon Musk,"This doesn't seem like it's gonna work out and we're rather busy.
"
20,9,Cartman,"Just give her a chance.  She's the smartest, funniest girl on Earth.
"
20,9,Elon Musk,"I haven't really heard her say anything funny.
"
20,9,Cartman,"Yeah,  that's because you have a mental block, Elon Musk.  They won't let you get over yourself.
"
20,9,Butters," He-heyeah! Don't worry about Heidi, she's a hoot.
"
20,9,Cartman,"
"
20,9,Dick,"Here they come.
"
20,9,,"
"
20,9,Gerald,"Oh thank god. There's been a mistake, okay?! I'm not one of  them. My son is Skankhunt42. Go online and see, he's still doing it!
"
20,9,Dane 2,"
"
20,9,Bedrager,"All of you, remove your clothes.
"
20,9,Anonymous821,"What are you gonna do with us?
"
20,9,Bedrager,"Remove your clothes now!
"
20,9,,"
"
20,9,Dane 2," In here, move.
"
20,9,,"
"
20,9,Gerald," Oh god! Oh god, they're gonna  kill us! No no, wait! Okay okay, it was me! You're right, I'm Skankhunt! But I am not like them. Please,  I have a good job! I'm a good guy!  I'm sorry!  I was just being funny! I was trying to make people laugh!  That's a positive thing, right?! I wasn't doing it to hurt people, I was just doing comedy. It's different! Please, it's different!
"
20,9,,"
"
20,9,Maxi,"Lord, we look to thee on this to our most trouble hour. We have been let astray and now all we could do is wait for the inevitable to happen. Soon everything we have said and done online is going to be known to all. Many lives will be turned upside down. Of course, I have nothing to worry about; since I'm a priest, there's nothing I'm ashamed of doing on the Internet, so  definitely no reason to look up my history. But uh for many, this is a time to pray.
"
20,9,Everyone," O'Lord, please forgive for things we might have done online.
"
20,9,Harrison,"Maggie.
"
20,9,Men,"Please try to understand that even some of us who were on MatchingMavis.com, it was only out of curiosity, and not because we actually having an affair. Please understand that we might have used racial slurs, but only because it was to a close friend and never meant to be public.
"
20,9,Kyle," What are you all doing?!  Somebody's threatening your way of life and you all are just sitting here praying, like uh a bunch of babies?
"
20,9,Ike," Like a bunch of pussies!
"
20,9,Kyle,"Come on, this isn't South Park! What's happened to us?! We used to have a challenge and deal with it, then move onto the next one. Now we've just been dealing with trolling and Internet stuff over and over, week after week; and I don't know about you, but I'm getting pretty sick of it.
"
20,9,Randy,"Yeah.
"
20,9,Kyle," Now for once let's take a stand and try to end this. We can't let Denmark change who we are.
"
20,9,Randy,"Yeah, fuck Denmark.
"
20,9,Prayers," Yeah!
"
20,9,Kyle,"You guys need to, you know, call the President and get him to take action.
"
20,9,Prayers," Aw!
"
20,9,Stephen,"The President? He won't listen to us. He hates us now.
"
20,9,Randy,"No,  but there is somebody he will still listen to.
"
20,9,First General,"Mr. President, we're looking at global destabilization blinked we've never seen. Countries everywhere are terrified their Internet may be hacked.
"
20,9,Garrison,"Well what do they want me to do about it?
"
20,9,Second General,"You're the leader of the free world.  Everyone's looking to you to be the call and steady voice they all need.
"
20,9,Army Soldier," Mr. President? Mr. President, the Isreali prime minister is on Line 1, the chancellor of Germany is on Line 2, and a Mr. Slave is on Line 3.
"
20,9,Garrison,"Mr. Slave?  This is the President.
"
20,9,Mr. Slave," Hey, what's up?
"
20,9,Garrison,"Well well well, crawling outta the woodwork to try and get me back now that I am a big cheese?
"
20,9,Mr. Slave,"No, I'm calling because people want you to bomb Denmark.
"
20,9,Garrison,"Who wants me to bomb Denmark?
"
20,9,Mr. Slave,"Lots of people 'cause it's like gonna ruin their freedom of speech or something.
"
20,9,Garrison,"Mr. Slave, this is all very complicated, diplomatic stuff, okay? You can't just go bombing other countries.
"
20,9,Mr. Slave,"Oh Jesus Christ, you're such a little bitch.
"
20,9,Garrison,"Oh I'm a bitch, huh? I happen to be President, bitch!
"
20,9,Mr. Slave,"You're a little bitch, President. You're too scared to bomb anybody.
"
20,9,Garrison,"I'm not scared, my advisors have told me that I...
"
20,9,Mr. Slave,"Yeah, you're scared, just do what your little advisors tell you to do.
"
20,9,Garrison,"If I decide a military strike on Denmark is warranted, then I will...
"
20,9,Mr. Slave,"You don't have the balls to bomb them, pussy.
"
20,9,Ike,"Pussy ass bitch.
"
20,9,Mr. Slave,"Pussy ass bitch, fuck you.
"
20,9,Garrison,"Oh  okay! You think so, huh?! Well watch this you gay asshole!  Bomb Denmark!
"
20,9,First General,"Sir?
"
20,9,Garrison," The TrollTrace building or the whole fucking thing! Whatever it is, get the missiles ready!
"
20,9,Mr. Slave," Yeah, it worked.
"
20,9,Kyle,"Alright!
"
20,9,,"
"
20,9,Butters," Hello. 
"
20,9,Cartman," What are you doing?
"
20,9,Butters," Going pee!
"
20,9,Cartman,"I mean what are you doing here calling my girlfriend funny? You better back off! You don't even know her, your just saying it! How do you even know she's funny?!
"
20,9,Butters,"Because you keep on telling everyone she is.
"
20,9,Cartman,"Butters, Heidi is everything to me.  If you take her, I swear to god...
"
20,9,Butters,"Eric Eric, trust me! I want nothing to do with girlfriends!  I know what girlfriends do; they make you feel happy like you never felt, then they crawl up inside of you and poop out your heart.
"
20,9,Cartman,"What are you talking about?
"
20,9,Butters,"That's how it ends, Eric. Girls get you to feel for them, make you think they're the best thing in the world, and then they leave, move on to the next thing; and you're left there crying, with your heart covered in poop.
"
20,9,Cartman,"Not Heidi, she's different. She's really smart, and really funny.
"
20,9,Butters,"Sure buddy, sure.
"
20,9,Kyle,"Officials have stated that all communication with Denmark has end, and that a military strike on the country is now imminent.
"
20,9,Ike,"Yay!
"
20,9,Kyle,"The President stated that since then...
"
20,9,Sheila," Are you serious right now?!
"
20,9,Kyle & Ike,"Augh! 
"
20,9,Sheila," Get off that computerrrr!
"
20,9,Kyle,"Ma, we were just using it to look at the news.
"
20,9,Sheila,"I don't care, I said no computers! You kids are addicted to the Internet! You're sick, and you're addicted! It's changed your brother, and now it's turning you against me, Kyle!
"
20,9,Kyle,"I'm not against you, mom.
"
20,9,Sheila,"You are! Your father goes away on business and all you do is defy me at every turn! The next time you defy me, it will be your last! Do you understand?!
"
20,9,Kyle & Ike,"Yes, mom.
"
20,9,Sheila,"And when your father gets home from Denmark, you two are both going in for counseling.
"
20,9,Kyle & Ike," Denmark?
"
20,9,Kyle,"What is dad doing in Denmark?!
"
20,9,Sheila,"The government sent him over to do paralegal training, so it would've nice if you could've shown a little support! 
"
20,9,Ike,"Ohhh shit.
"
20,9,Gerald,"Oh God! 
"
20,9,Anonymous821,"Will somebody shut him up?
"
20,9,Dick,"Skank. Skank, get ahold of yourself
"
20,9,Gerald,"You were right, Dildo, when you said I was a dick, when you called me an asshole. I am. And now I'm going to die alone, just like you said (starts crying again)
"
20,9,Dick,"Come on. You're not an asshole
"
20,9,Gerald," You said I was, though, 'cause I only trolled to be...funny.
"
20,9,Dick,"Well--Well, maybe being funny is just sort of how you deal with serious subjects.
"
20,9,Gerald," Really? You don't think I'm a bad person? I'm sorry. All you guys, I'm sorry.
"
20,9,Trolls,"That's okay. Okay, Skank. All right
"
20,9,Gerald," Excuse me. Hello?
"
20,9,Gerald,"Could I please speak to the person in charge?  I have something to say.  Please, just for a moment? 
"
20,9,Bedrager," Bring him to the conference room
"
20,9,Heidi," , Dude, I am so not getting this.
"
20,9,Cartman," 
"
20,9,Cartman," I just don't understand it. She's always been really smart before. And hilarious.
"
20,9,Butters,"Don't feel bad about getting duped, Eric. Its happened to all of us.
"
20,9,Cartman," Nobody's been duped! Stop suggesting that she's being manipulative. Why would she want to trick me?
"
20,9,Butters,"The truth is girls hate us, Eric. They're sick of our shit. And one day, they plan to make us obsolete, stick us underground where we just get milked for our semen. Boys' only hope is to start over on Mars.
"
20,9,Cartman," That's ridiculous. That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Heidi is the smartest, funniest person I've ever met. I'm not being tricked. And I'll prove it to everybody!
"
20,9,Gerald,"Oh, my gosh. Thank you so much for talking to me. I just really needed to get something off my chest. I'm so sorry. I had the biggest epiphany about the damage I've done, the people I've hurt, but the fact of the matter is I'm not really a troll.  I actually have a job. I'm a lawyer. I've got a loving wife and great kids. Uhm, I've got a family that really misses me and needs me.
"
20,9,Bedrager," Freja Ollegard, the volleyball player, had a family, too. They miss her quite a lot too.
"
20,9,Gerald,"And that--that is so tragic. And I'm so sorry that she was driven to kill herself by trolling. It's--It's wrong. But, you know, I just sort of set things in motion. See, I'm a satirist. I challenge people's point of views by being sort of edgy.  And sometimes, people can be like ""Whoa!"" and mistake that for hate, but its not hate. Its pointing out hypocrisies in out society. 
"
20,9,Bedrager,"You're so full of skinkinslat I can smell it from here.
"
20,9,Gerald,"If you say mean things and you're mean, then I agree, you should be killed. But if you're being funny, which spreads joy --
"
20,9,Bedrager,"You really think my plan is to kill you?
"
20,9,Gerald,"It's not?
"
20,9,Bedrager," Leave us.  Go. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
"
20,9,," 
"
20,9,Bedrager," Do you want to know what's really funny?
"
20,9,First General,"Mr. President, the bombers are en route to Europe.
"
20,9,Second General,"Are you sure you want to proceed with this?
"
20,9,Garrison,"Yeah, yeah. Bomb the shit out of them. We have to be tough here.
"
20,9,Army Soldier,"Mr. President? Mr. President, the Grand Duke of Luxembourg is on Line 1, the Chairman of the Worker's Party is on Line 2, and Kyle is on Line 3.
"
20,9,Garrison,"Oh geez. What does Kyle want.
"
20,9,,"
"
20,9,Garrison,"This is the President
"
20,9,Kyle," Mr. Garrison, you can't bomb Denmark!
"
20,9,Garrison,"Oh, for Pete's sake, Kyle.
"
20,9,Kyle,"It's--It's wrong and it could start a bigger war.
"
20,9,Garrison,"Kyle, this is all very serious diplomatic stuff, okay? You can't understand the political complexities involved here.
"
20,9,Kyle," I understand that you're a dipshit little gay puppet.
"
20,9,Garrison,"Excuse me?
"
20,9,Kyle,"Letting your ex-boyfriend manipulate you 'cause you miss his sweet ass.
"
20,9,Garrison,"Who told you that?
"
20,9,Kyle,"Everyone knows that. You only do what your little bitch boyfriend manipulates you into doing.
"
20,9,Garrison,"Kyle, I am the President.
"
20,9,Kyle,"You're a little dipshit president.
"
20,9,Ike,"With a dirty...asshole.
"
20,9,Kyle,"With a dirty asshole.
"
20,9,Ike,"And...you shit out your dick.
"
20,9,Kyle,"And you shit out your dick.  Where did you learn to talk like this?
"
20,9,Ike,"Daddy!
"
20,9,Garrison,"Oh that's what people think, huh? Well, maybe I won't bomb Denmark. What do you think about that?
"
20,9,Kyle,"Yeah, you will, because you're a little retarded shit bitch.
"
20,9,Garrison," God fucking damn it  Hold up! Hold up on the fucking bombs a minute!
"
20,9,Cartman," Hey, babe. Uh, how's it going?
"
20,9,Heidi," I don't understand what any of these symbols mean, so in my head I'm trying to replace them with something I know to try and see patterns.
"
20,9,Cartman," Okay, cool. Uh, babe, you remember that funny thing you were saying about soup the other day. What was that again?
"
20,9,Heidi,"And when I do that, I can see how everything lines up except for one thing.
"
20,9,," 
"
20,9,Heidi," I call it  ""Emoji Analysis"" .
"
20,9,Cartman,"Do you--you remember that funny voice you did at McDonald's? You were like ""Could you--Could you hand me my water,"" or something. I can't--I can't remember.
"
20,9,Heidi,"These two don't line up, babe. The only things that are out of order.
"
20,9,Cartman,"Or the time you said the thing about clouds and I was laughing so hard--What was that again?
"
20,9,Heidi," Excuse me. Is it possible that the seventh line from the right and the third one up from the bottom left are out of sequence?
"
20,9,,"
"
20,9,SpaceX Employee,"I'm sorry?
"
20,9,Heidi,"That stuff there. Its in the wrong place. It needs to come before that.
"
20,9,,"
"
20,9,Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker," Wait a minute. She might be on to something here
"
20,9,Cartman,"Okay, okay, now could you just do the ""my vagina"" thing for them? Could you just say ""my vagina""?
"
20,9,Heidi," They're out of sequence! I'll show you! 
"
20,9,Cartman,"What the fuck is happening?
"
20,9,Bedrager," Do you remember, Mr. a-Skankhunt, when you and your little buddies trolled the entire country of a-Denmark?
"
20,9,Gerald,"And that was wrong, too. I certainly want to apologize for that.
"
20,9,Bedrager," That was certainly a display of the power of a-trolling, wasn't it. But, what would be even more impressive?
"
20,9,Gerald,"I-I don't understand.
"
20,9,Bedrager,"What if you could troll the entire world? Somebody who could rise to political power through nothing more that pushing people's a-buttons and getting them all riled up, become the leader of...a Scandinavian country, perhaps, get them to listen to you when, actually... you're not even fucking Danish.
"
20,9,Gerald,"No way.
"
20,9,Bedrager,"Use that country to create a machine that relies on the shittiness of people to fuck over other people and watch the whole world go completely batshit.
"
20,9,," 
"
20,9,Bedrager," Attention all a-TrollTrace workers. Please report to assembly hall one for a big announcement.  Completely fool everyone  and keep your real intentions completely anonymous.
"
20,9,Gerald,"You would--deliberately start World War III, let the people of Denmark die, set everyone on Earth against each other? Why?!
"
20,9,Bedrager,"Because its freakin' hilarious! Getting a Scandinavian country to fight trolls by building a giant machine that actually shows everyone on Earth is kind of a troll, too?
"
20,9,Gerald,"That's not funny.
"
20,9,Bedrager,"That's not funny?! Don't be a fag, dude! That's real bro shit there. Sorry to step on your fucking dicks in the mouth and tit jokes, you amateur little pussy. Come on! Have some fucking balls!
"
20,9,Gerald,"You can't do this to people! It's not right!
"
20,9,Bedrager," Listen to you.  All right, everyone. Show's about to begin. 
"
20,9,,"
"
20,9,Dick," What the fuck is going on?!
"
20,9,,"
"
20,9,Music video,"Never gonna give you up. Never gonna let you down. Never gonna run around and desert you.
"
20,9,TrollTrace Employee,"Uh-oh.
"
20,9,,"
"
20,9,Dick,"Wow. That's pretty impressive.
"
20,9,Gerald,"Waaiitt!!!
"
20,9,,"
"
20,9,Kyle," Ike...It's time.  I don't know if I'm strong enough to go through with this, but its the only way now.
"
20,9,Ike,"I know.
"
20,9,Kyle,"Just remember--I always loved you, little brother.
"
20,9,Ike,"I love you too, big brother.
"
20,9,Kyle,"Let's...just get this over with.
"
20,9,Ike,"Mommy?
"
20,9,Sheila,"Yes?
"
20,9,Ike,"Suck my balls. You're a fat bitch. 
"
20,9,Sheila," Whhaaatt!  You get back here, you little monster!
"
20,9,,"
"
20,9,Sheila," I have had it with you! Don't you run away from me, Ike! Who do you think you are?!  Where is he?! Where is your brother?!
"
20,9,Kyle,"He's in the pantry.
"
20,9,Sheila," Don't you try and hide from me now! You are in big trouble, Ike!  Whaaatt!?  What, what!? Kyle, you open this door right now!! 
"
20,9,Kyle,"Ma. Mom, we are really sorry...
"
20,9,Sheila," Open this door! 
"
20,9,Kyle,"But Ike and I have to do something and we have to be able to use the computers.
"
20,9,Sheila," What,what?! No computers! Do not touch the computerrrrrs! 
"
20,9,Kyle,"We have to do this, Mom. Its the only thing that can save our family now.
"
20,9,Sheila," You are done! You hear me?! You are both done!  
"
20,10,General Revaur,"Mr. President? Russians are scrambling bombers to attack Denmark. NATO wants to know how we intend to stop them. Mr. President?...Mr. President you can't just sit there with your ""stank face"".
"
20,10,Mr. Garrison,"Iah-uhk-uh-I cain't?
"
20,10,Military Officer,"The TrollTrace website is set to go online in less than fifteen minutes, the world is in complete chaos!
"
20,10,NSA Agent," Sir, someone is leading a coordinated cyber strike on the TrollTrace website.
"
20,10,Mr. Garrison," A cyber attack, well that's good! Where's it comin' from?
"
20,10,NSA Agent,"It could be Russian, we don't know. Whoever this troll is, he's pretty fucking hardcore sir.
"
20,10,Kyle,"Okay, okay, Tolkien? Tolkien are you there?
"
20,10,Tolkien,"I'm here, what's this about Kyle?
"
20,10,Kyle,"I can't tell you dude, I just need your
Smokin'


help...Please, my life depends
Smokin'

 on it.
"
20,10,Tolkien,"Okay, okay sure.
I feel alright, mamma...


"
20,10,Kyle,"Alright, 
I'm not jokin', yeah

 I need you to tell me the worst thing I can say on the United Negro College Fund website to piss off black people.
"
20,10,Tolkien,"What!?
"
20,10,Kyle,"Tolkien, please! There's no time to explain!
"
20,10,Tolkien,"Beyonce ain't nothin' but a Taylor Swift ripoff.
"
20,10,Kyle,"That helps thank you.
"
20,10,Kyle,"Tweek, Craig, I need you to get on the GLAAD website and respond to all the horrible shit I just said about gay people.
"
20,10,Craig,"Why'd you say horrible shit about gay people?
"
20,10,Kyle,"It's not important, just get on it and respond.
"
20,10,Kyle," Hang on.  Stan! Finally. Dude I need everybody online now!
"
20,10,Stan,"For what?
"
20,10,Kyle,"Dude, there's no time to explain, you gotta go out and get everybody, tell them to get on their computers, go!
"
20,10,Stan," Okay!
"
20,10,Kyle,"Jimmy, what's the worst possible thing you could say on a website for handicapped Syrian refugees?
"
20,10,Jimmy,"Wuh-Wuh-Waddle back to Syria you desert-tard. 
"
20,10,Sheila,"You boys...better not be on that computaaaaaaah! I'll make you pay for this. You locked your mother in the pantry? I'll lock you in your rooms forevaaah.
"
20,10,Dildo Shwaggins,"Skank
"
20,10,Gerald,"Dildo?
"
20,10,Dildo Shwaggins,"Skankhunt, can you hear me?
"
20,10,Gerald,"Yes! Yes, where are you?
"
20,10,Dildo Shwaggins,"The troll locked us in the control room with his Danish workers.
"
20,10,Gerald,"How long before the website goes online?
"
20,10,Danish Worker,"Less than ten mienutes.
"
20,10,Gerald,"Oh God!
"
20,10,Dildo Shwaggins,"Skankhunt! The TrollTrace servers monitor and catalog outrage and hate on the internet, there's a troll out there trying to overload them by generating tons of hate.
"
20,10,Dildo Shwaggins,"Skank, whoever's doing it is doing it from your account.
"
20,10,Gerald,"My account?
"
20,10,Dildo Shwaggins,"Yeah, he's pissing off a lot of people.
"
20,10,Gerald," That's my boy!
"
20,10,Female SpaceX Worker,"The core energy is completely stable, and very easy to reduce. It's the most massive energy source of its size we've ever seen.
"
20,10,Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker,"We've done it Elon, with this type of energy we can easily get mankind to Mars.
"
20,10,Elon Musk,"This is amazing! And it's all thanks to you little girl, how did you get to be so smart?
"
20,10,Heidi,"I just-- have a boyfriend who really supports me.
"
20,10,Elon Musk,"Well, c'mon, I wanna know everything about you.
"
20,10,Cartman,"Conniving, snakes-in-the-grass. All of them.
"
20,10,Butters,"Yep.
"
20,10,Cartman,"We have to tell someone the truth, Butters.
"
20,10,Butters,"Are you sure about what's going to happen on Mars.
"
20,10,Cartman,"It's all been leading up to this, we've just been too blind to see it before.
"
20,10,Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker,"Hey, you guys need anything? Water, Soda?
"
20,10,Cartman,"Maybe just a moment alone, to talk?
"
20,10,Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker,"Sure, about what?
"
20,10,Cartman,"The end of our species.
"
20,10,Kyle,"All right, who else we got now, Kevin are you there, Kenny?
"
20,10,Kevin,"Ye-I, I typed in everything you told me to.
"
20,10,Kenny,"(Me too dude, what's next?)
"
20,10,Ike,"Kyle, I wanna help tooo.
"
20,10,Kyle,"No, Ike. So far the only thing you've done is from dad's account, we need you to stay clean. No trolling, Okay!? You can just help me with what I should say.
"
20,10,Dildo Shwaggins,"Hello? Can you hear me? This is Dildo Shwaggins.
"
20,10,Kyle,"Who are you?
"
20,10,Dildo Shwaggins,"I'm a colleague of your fathers. We see what you're trying to do, and we're gonna help, we trolled with your father, now we will troll with you.
"
20,10,Kyle,"O-- Okay?
"
20,10,Dildo Shwaggins,"Son, you need to know that your father is very proud of you. He was the best at Trevor's Axiom, he believes you can be too.
"
20,10,Kyle,"What the hell is ""Trevor's Axiom""?
"
20,10,NSA Agent,"Trevor's Axiom is a well-known equation in online trolling.
"
20,10,NSA Agent,"It's a way in which one person can create a massive reaction on the Internet. Look, person A trolls person B, but it's not about person B, the troll is trying to push buttons to try and get a reaction from hundreds, eventually creating person C, whose overreaction and self righteousness will elicit a reaction from persons D through F, who weren't trolls but can't help rip on person C.
"
20,10,NSA Agent,"Their reactions lead to outrage persons G through N, and it keeps going, generating massive energy, it's like the fission reaction that leads to a fusion explosion, all bringing out the worst in humanity.
"
20,10,Mr. Garrison,"Huh, that sorta sounds like how I got elected.
"
20,10,NSA Agent,"Precisely, Mr. President, and if this kind of overreaction can be amplified through the Pentagon servers...
"
20,10,General Revaur," It could blow up the Internet before TrollTrace ever does substantial damage.
"
20,10,Mr. Garrison,"Gentlemen, get me in contact with that troll.
"
20,10,Cartman,"Listen, there isn't much time. This whole thing has to be stopped. We can't go to Mars.
"
20,10,Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker,"You keep saying that, but not why.
"
20,10,Butters,"Because Eric knows the future.
"
20,10,Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker,"What are you talking about?
"
20,10,Cartman,"I've had visions of Mars for the past few months. I'm a visionary. That's why I came, why I brought her.
"
20,10,Cartman,"But the visions weren't complete until recently. I know what happens on Mars.
"
20,10,Cartman (Voiceover),"At first, you'll be super-happy, bouncing around the red sand.
"
20,10,Cartman,"Everyone will be really nice.
"
20,10,Female 1,"Hi!
"
20,10,Female 2,"Hi!
"
20,10,Cartman,"Hi!
"
20,10,Cartman,"You'll think the rover cars and roller coasters are really cool.
"
20,10,Cartman,"But then, you'll realize something--The other colonists all seem to be women.
"
20,10,Cartman,"Hmm, let's see
"
20,10,Cartman,"And then you'll start to wonder, ""Where are all the other guys?""
"
20,10,Butters," Look underground.
"
20,10,Cartman,"And soon, you'll realize there's areas you didn't understand the purpose for.
"
20,10,Cartman,"What is this place?
"
20,10,Cartman,"And that's when you'll learn the truth...
"
20,10,Cartman,"Men have been forced underground, deemed useless by women.
"
20,10,Cartman,"They are mined for the only things women still need us for, our semen, and our jokes.
"
20,10,Cartman,"What?! No, no!
"
20,10,Cartman,"You're just as funny as us! You don't need to do this!
"
20,10,Cartman,"Nooooooo! No, no!
"
20,10,Female 3,"Write jokes!
"
20,10,Cartman,"No! No!
"
20,10,Cartman,"And you'll be trapped down there forever, in the cum and joke mines of Mars.
"
20,10,Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker,"That's, That's ridiculous. Why would women need us to do that? They're just as funny as men.
"
20,10,Cartman,"If there's even a little part of you that really doesn't believe that, then think about what else has to be going on.
"
20,10,Female SpaceX Employee,"What?
"
20,10,Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker,"What?
"
20,10,Cartman,"You have to help us stop this!
"
20,10,Gerald," Ah! God damn it!
"
20,10,Dildo Shwaggins,"Skank! You still there?
"
20,10,Gerald," Yeah, I'm here.
"
20,10,Dildo Shwaggins,"The servers are starting to heat up, but the Danish say there are breakers that will never let them overload. You got to climb up the building and shut off the breakers.
"
20,10,Gerald," I can't go anywhere. I'm locked in the conference room.
"
20,10,TrollTrace employee,"Oh, the key code to the conference room is 9...
"
20,10,Gerald," Yeah...?
"
20,10,TrollTrace employee,"That's it. 9.
"
20,10,Gerald," Oh, for fuck's sake! 
"
20,10,Sheila," Kyle! You better run if I get out of here! You better pray that---ah! 
"
20,10,Dildo Shwaggins," Skank. Skankhunt, are you there yet?
"
20,10,Gerald,"Yeah, I'm up with all the servers.
"
20,10,TrollTrace employee,"The first breaker should be there. Tell him to look for a large red lever.
"
20,10,Dildo Shwaggins," Skank, do you see a large red lever?
"
20,10,Gerald," Yeah, I got it 
"
20,10,Dildo Shwaggins," Flip it off
"
20,10,Dildo Shwaggins," That's good. Keep going Skankhunt.
"
20,10,Ike,"You are all dumbass... fuckwads.
"
20,10,Ike,"Lick my asshole, you Mexican... bitch.
"
20,10,Sheila,"Ike!
"
20,10,Ike,"
"
20,10,Sheila," You dare lock me in the pantry, so you can play on your computer?!
"
20,10,Ike,"Mommy!
"
20,10,Sheila," You're gonna pay for what you have done!
"
20,10,Ike,"Aah! 
"
20,10,Ike,"Kyle!
"
20,10,Sheila,"Ike!
"
20,10,Kyle," Shit!
"
20,10,Ike,"Mommy got out!
"
20,10,Sheila," You...! You helped turned your brother this way!
"
20,10,Kyle,"Mom, there's been a mistake. Ike isn't the school troll. We're trying to help--
"
20,10,Sheila,"Shut up! Not another word from either of you! You're both grounded from the computer...forever!
"
20,10,Kyle,"Mom, please, you got to listen to me. Ike is innocent
"
20,10,Sheila," Do you think I'm stupid?!
"
20,10,Kyle,"No, Mom. You just don't know everything. 
"
20,10,Sheila,"You both march out of here, right now!
"
20,10,Kyle,"I'm sorry, Mom. I'm just trying to protect my family
"
20,10,Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker,"Look, Elon, I'm just saying before we go any further, you might want to hear this kid out. 
"
20,10,Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker,"Go on, tell Elon.
"
20,10,Cartman,"Elon, I know you've dreamt of mankind getting to Mars, but its not going to be very kind to man. They're going to put us underground.
"
20,10,Elon Musk,"For what?
"
20,10,Cartman,"What's the one thing women don't have? Semen and a sense of humor.
"
20,10,Elon Musk,"That's two things.
"
20,10,Cartman,"They're pretty related.
"
20,10,Elon Musk,"Women don't need us for comedy. They can be just as funny as men. You should meet my girlfriend. She's really smart and really funny.
"
20,10,Cartman,"Oh, Elon. Oh, Christ, Elon.
"
20,10,Butters,"I used to think women were funny, too, but Eric talked me out of it.
"
20,10,Cartman,"It's something they do to our brains. They attract us like flies to the spiderweb. And then they make you think they're really smart, really funny. But they're only really smart, Elon.
"
20,10,Cartman,"They can live without us. We can't live without them.
"
20,10,Cartman,"If even 1/16th of you believes that women might not be as funny as men, Elon-- Elon?
"
20,10,Kyle,"Why don't you kill yourself? Trust me, no one will care.
"
20,10,Ike,"You fat hooker.
"
20,10,Kyle,"You fat hooker. Ike, when this is all over, we're gonna need to clean your mouth out.
"
20,10,Ike,"You clean your fucking mouth out.
"
20,10,Kyle,"Stan! You still haven't found Butters yet? Dude, I need his hatred towards women right now!
"
20,10,Stan,"Dude, he's not around anywhere. He must be out of town.
"
20,10,Kyle,"Shit!
"
20,10,Kyle,"Hold on...
"
20,10,Mr. Garrison,"Kyle?!
"
20,10,Kyle," Oh, hey, Mr. President
"
20,10,Mr. Garrison,"Kyle, you're the troll who started all this?!
"
20,10,Kyle,"Uh...what do you mean?
"
20,10,Mr. Garrison,"Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me. So long as you keep doing what you're doing. The American government is behind you.
"
20,10,Kyle," It is?
"
20,10,Mr. Garrison,"Keep up the good work. We're gonna take that big shitstorm of hate you're creating and amplify it. We'll try to create enough energy to blow up the whole fucking internet.  You're doing God's work, son. Keep it up.
"
20,10,Kyle," Thanks?
"
20,10,Bedrager,"Oh, no, you don't.
"
20,10,Sheila,"Laura, have my boys come to see Craig? They're hiding from me.
"
20,10,Sheila,"What? What? What?
"
20,10,Laura," The son of a bitch. He's such a bastard.
"
20,10,Laura,"When you marry someone and you think you know them...
"
20,10,Sheila,"I don't know what you're talking about.
"
20,10,Laura,"TrollTrace. Its up and running. 
"
20,10,Laura,"It can tell you anybody's Internet history. 
"
20,10,Laura,"I couldn't resist. I looked up my husband.  The websites he's visited are just...disgusting!
"
20,10,Sheila,"May I use this a moment?
"
20,10,Laura,"Sure. Type in any name. It'll show you everything they've ever done online. Be careful. You might not like what you see.
"
20,10,Cartman,"What the hell am I going to do, Butters? Semen and a sense of humor. I can't live without Heidi. I know I'll be miserable. But I also can't live on the cum and joke mines of Mars.
"
20,10,Butters,"Gee, I don't know what to tell you, buddy.
"
20,10,Cartman,"If I stay on Earth where the internet is, Heidi finds out I know women aren't actually funny. And if I go to Mars, I get milked like a goat.
"
20,10,Butters,"What?!
"
20,10,Kyle,"Butters! Where the fuck are you?!
"
20,10,Butters,"Oh, I'm at SpaceX. Where are you?
"
20,10,Kyle,"SpaceX? Why?!
"
20,10,Butters,"Well, we sort of created this ginormic energy source, but now, we're trying to figure out what to do with it.
"
20,10,Kyle," Like...how ginormic of an energy source?
"
20,10,Butters,"Like enough to get humanity to Mars.
"
20,10,Cartman," Is that Kyle?
"
20,10,Cartman," Kyle, do you mind? I'm having really big girl problems right now.
"
20,10,Kyle,"Cartman, I think we might be able to help each other.
"
20,10,Dildo Shwaggins," Skank, there's no more time! Have you found the last breaker?
"
20,10,Gerald,"I think so. I-I'm up on some kind of bridgeway.
"
20,10,TrollTrace employee,"That last breaker should be there
"
20,10,Gerald,"Heading to it now!
"
20,10,Bedrager,"I'm ten steps ahead of you!
"
20,10,Bedrager,"What's the matter Skankhunt? You just can't stand to be outdone, huh?
"
20,10,Gerald,"Get out of my way. What you're doing is wrong!
"
20,10,Bedrager,"What I'm doing is wrong? How is getting millions of people to kill themselves different from getting one person to?
"
20,10,Gerald,"It's completely heartless and malicious!
"
20,10,Bedrager,"You can honestly stand there, as a troll, and tell me that what I'm doing isn't hilarious?
"
20,10,Gerald,"No! Its not! Hacking the world to show that most people act differently online isn't even technically satirical.
"
20,10,Bedrager,"How is not satirical?
"
20,10,Sheila,"There's nothing here.
"
20,10,Sheila,"Maybe Kyle was telling the truth. 
"
20,10,Sheila,"Oh Laura! I think my boys were being honest with me.
"
20,10,Laura,"About what?
"
20,10,Sheila,"I accused Ike of...of...well, I can't really say, but this thing says that he's clean. I got to find my boys, Laura. Thank you so much. 
"
20,10,Laura,"Its not our kids we have to be worried about. 
"
20,10,Laura,"My husband was on three ""married-but-dating"" websites! He looked at porn 4,000 times in one month! Aren't you curious about what your husband does? Huh? Sure he doesn't have any girlfriends?
"
20,10,Sheila,"No, I-I have to respect Gerald's privacy.
"
20,10,Laura,"Sure, yeah. Respect. Nice of you to give him that. 
"
20,10,Laura,"Come on, you really think you can resist the urge to type in his name...just for a quick little look?
"
20,10,NSA Agent,"There's nothing more we can do. Nearly everyone is online and we diverted all the power we can.
"
20,10,Army General 2," Mr. President, TrollTrace has been online for almost 15 minutes now. Its too late. We need to get you down to the bunker.
"
20,10,Mr. Garrison,"Oh I got a bunker? Well that's good.
"
20,10,Soldier," Mr. President, we have an urgent call from Kyle.
"
20,10,Mr. Garrison," Sorry, Kyle. Looks like its not going to work.
"
20,10,Kyle," Mr. Garrison, I might have just found a lot more energy. Is there anyway the Pentagon can connect to SpaceX?
"
20,10,Mr. Garrison,"SpaceX? What the fuck is that?
"
20,10,Kyle," You know, the company trying to find new forms of energy, create jobs and get mankind to Mars.
"
20,10,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, that's dumb, but go on.
"
20,10,Gerald,"Okay, okay, look. What you're doing is just trying to prove that everyone is either a bad person or a snoop, right? So how is that funny?
"
20,10,Bedrager,"That's not what I'm doing. I'm showing everyone that all this stuff that they freak out over doesn't even matter.
"
20,10,Gerald,"No, but see, that's just nihilism.
"
20,10,Bedrager,"Oh, come on!
"
20,10,Gerald,"That is!
"
20,10,Bedrager,"So--so wait! If you do some big, outrageous, offensive thing with a positive attitude, you're a satirist, but if you're cynical about it, then you're a nihilist? That's fucking ridiculous!
"
20,10,Gerald,"You're trying to get people to go to war and kill each other.
"
20,10,Bedrager,"So maybe this is like the new post-funny era of satire.
"
20,10,Cartman,"Attention all SpaceX employees. 
"
20,10,Cartman,"Please evacuate the building immediately. 
"
20,10,Cartman,"We just received a bomb threat from NASA. This is not a drill. 
"
20,10,Cartman,"The NASA terrorists are super-jelly of us. Please quietly and calmly find the nearest exit and get the fuck out as fast as you can.  Ah!  Oh, hey, babe. Wh-What's up?
"
20,10,Heidi,"There's a bomb threat?
"
20,10,Cartman,"Oh yeah, I was just...They told me on the stifernisy thing. It was spinning. Come on, we better get out. 
"
20,10,Heidi,"Babe, is everything okay? You seem...distantly lately.
"
20,10,Cartman,"Distant? Really? Oh my God. I-I'm sorry.
"
20,10,Heidi,"Did I do something wrong?
"
20,10,Cartman," No. No, Heidi. Why would you think that? 
"
20,10,Heidi,"You don't really talk to me the same way you used to. Oh, God, I'm sounding needy, huh?
"
20,10,Cartman,"Uh-huh, uh-huh. Yeah, go on.
"
20,10,Heidi,"Eric, I just--I hope that you're always honest with me, even if you think it might hurt my feelings.
"
20,10,Cartman,"Uh-huh. Yeah, cool. Heidi, I'll always do what's best both of us. 
"
20,10,Cartman,"Now come on we got to get outside.
"
20,10,Sheila,"I shouldn't do this.
"
20,10,Gerald,"I can't argue with you anymore. I want to stand here and tell you that you and I are different, but its not true. 
"
20,10,Gerald,"All we've been doing is making excuses for being horrible people. 
"
20,10,Gerald,"I don't know if you tried to teach me a lesson, but you have. 
"
20,10,Gerald,"I have to stand here and look at you, and all I see is a big fat reflection of myself.  With only one minor difference.
"
20,10,Bedrager,"Noooooo!!!
"
20,10,Gerald,"Ha! Fuck you! What I do is fucking funny, bitch!
"
20,10,Dildo Shwaggins,"That's it. Your dad's got it. Give it everything you got!
"
20,10,Kyle,"Mr. President, do it!
"
20,10,Mr. Garrison,"Reroute the internet through SpaceX!.
"
20,10,Pentagon Employee,"Rerouting now!
"
20,10,Sheila," What the hell just happened?!
"
20,10,Cartman,"Well, looks like you're gonna have to kind of start over, huh, Elon?.
"
20,10,Cartman,"Maybe you should just go back to your little cars, huh?
"
20,10,Heidi,"Wow, babe. Looks like all our dreams are kind of on hold for a while, huh?
"
20,10,Cartman,"Yeah, well some people's dreams are other people's nightmares.
"
20,10,Heidi,"Well, what do you mean?
"
20,10,Cartman,"It was a joke.
"
20,10,Kyle (voiceover),"And so, life goes on.
"
20,10,Kyle (voiceover),"The end of civilization didn't happen.
"
20,10,Kyle (voiceover),"A massive electrical pulse completely erased the internet.
"
20,10,Kyle (voiceover),"We've been given a second chance.
"
20,10,Kyle (voiceover),"A mulligan.
"
20,10,Kyle (voiceover),"Anything we might be ashamed of, gone forever.
"
20,10,Kyle (voiceover),"Maybe now boys and girls can learn to respect each other again.
"
