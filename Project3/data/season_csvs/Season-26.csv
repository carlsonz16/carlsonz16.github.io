26,1,Kyle,"Hey, dudes.
"
26,1,Stan,"Hey, what's up?
"
26,1,Kyle,"Just wondering if you guys have seen me and Tolkien's latest TikTok?
"
26,1,Stan,"You guys made another TikTok?
"
26,1,Tolkien,"I think it's really our best one yet!
"
26,1,Cartman,"Yeah, nobody really gives a shit about your TikToks, guys. 
"
26,1,Bebe,"Hey, really great TikTok guys!
"
26,1,Kyle and Tolkien,"Oh, thanks!
"
26,1,Red,"Yeah, it was pretty amazing.
"
26,1,Tolkien,"Awesome.
"
26,1,Kyle,"Well, anyway you guys gotta check it out when you get a chance. See ya later!

"
26,1,Cartman,"What the fuck is this? Seriously, what the fuck is this? Have you guys noticed that Kyle and Tolkien are, like, doing everything together lately?
"
26,1,Stan,"Yeah, they're quite the little team, aren't they?
"
26,1,Stan,"I, uh... I'm gonna go inside, guys. I'm gonna get some homework done. 
"
26,1,Cartman,"Wow. I feel really bad for Stan. It's gotta be hard to suddenly have your best friend always hanging with someone else.
"
26,1,Kenny,"(Yeah.)
"
26,1,Cartman,"I gotta see if there's some way I can help. There's a little voice inside of me that can't stand to see my friend suffer.
"
26,1,Kenny,"(What are you gonna do?)
"
26,1,Cartman,"I'm gonna be a good Christian.
"
26,1,Mr Romero,"Okay, just the woodwinds for this section.
"
26,1,Cartman,"Hey, Tolkien! What's goin' on?
"
26,1,Tolkien,"This is the brass section.
"
26,1,Cartman,"Yeah, I know. I was just - I was noticing that you're kind of hanging out a lot with Kyle lately.
"
26,1,Tolkien,"Is there a problem with that?
"
26,1,Cartman,"No, I think it's amazing. It's awesome that someone like you could be okay with someone like him, given all the new information lately.
"
26,1,Cartman,"You know, the stuff that's come out about how the Jews stole the black race's identity, that the lost tribes of Judah were actually all Africans.  You didn't hear about this? Black people are actually the Jews and people like Kyle have taken that from them?
"
26,1,Tolkien," Stop talking to me.
"
26,1,Cartman,"When the Jews came to America to escape persecution in World War II, they found that Blacks were already the underclass in America, so they had to invent a story for themselves which they can make everyone believe...  ...because Kyle runs Hollywood!
"
26,1,Cartman," Kyle runs Hollywood, Tolkien.
"
26,1,Cartman,"Hey, Stan. Guess what? I have some good news for you.
"
26,1,Stan,"What?
"
26,1,Cartman,"A little magic fairy told me that you and Kyle are gonna get back together soon.
"
26,1,Stan,"I don't care that Kyle is making TikToks with Tolkien.
"
26,1,Cartman,"Yes, you do. But don't worry, Stan. It's almost Valentine's Day. And the little angel on my shoulder says that Kyle is gonna come running back to you any minute!
"
26,1,Kyle,"Hey, Stan.
"
26,1,Stan,"Oh! Hey, Kyle.
"
26,1,Kenny,"(Woah.)
"
26,1,Cartman,"Uh-huh.
"
26,1,Stan,"Well, dude, do you wanna sit down?
"
26,1,Kyle,"Oh, no sorry. I was actually just seeing if you had a phone charger I could borrow. Me and Tolkien are making another TikTok video and my stupid phone died!
"
26,1,Stan," Oh, yeah, sure...
"
26,1,Kyle,"Thanks, dude!  Tolkien, I got one, dude!
"
26,1,Cartman,"The fuck is going on?
"
26,1,Stan,"Well... um, I'm gonna head back to class, guys. 
"
26,1,Cartman,"I don't get it. The little cupid is always right.
"
26,1,Kenny,"(Well, not this time.) 
"
26,1,Cartman,"Why didn't Tolkien listen?
"
26,1,Cupid Ye,"Did you tell him about the Black Hebrew tribes?
"
26,1,Cartman,"Yeah, I told him everything, Cupid Ye!
"
26,1,Cupid Ye,"Tee hee hee!  And did you tell him how the Jews stole Black people's identity?
"
26,1,Cartman,"Yeah, but it didn't work, Cupid Ye.
"
26,1,Cupid Ye,"That's okay, Eric! Remember, being a good Christian means helping people even when it's hard.
"
26,1,Cartman,"You're right, Cupid Ye. Can you help make sure Tolkien hears our message?
"
26,1,Cupid Ye,"Spreading information is like spreading love. I'll help you get the word out, Eric! Tee hee hee! Tee hee heeeee!
"
26,1,Kyle,"Wow, that's so cool, Tolkien! Look how many likes we're getting for this one.
"
26,1,Clyde,"Hey, Kyle, you got a minute?
"
26,1,Kyle,"Yeah, what's up?
"
26,1,Clyde,"Well, there's this rumor starting to go around the school. Kids are saying that, like... I don't know, that, like, you run Hollywood?
"
26,1,Kyle,"What?
"
26,1,Clyde,"I told Scott that that's just people being dumb and he shouldn't listen to stuff like that.  But... Scott and I do have this sweet movie idea about a dude who has guns for hands and we have the first 20 pages written, so...  You don't really run Hollywood, right?
"
26,1,Kyle," I'm not even going to justify that with a response. Because repeating a derogatory slur, even for the purpose of refuting it, can make stupid people think it's valid! 
"
26,1,Clyde,"Holy shit, Kyle runs Hollywood...
"
26,1,Scott,"Kyle runs Hollywood, and you fucked up the pitch!
"
26,1,Clyde,"How'd I fuck up the pitch?!
"
26,1,Scott,"You gotta tell him what the stakes are. People who make movies, they just care about the stakes!
"
26,1,Clyde,"The guy has guns for hands!
"
26,1,PC Principal,"Mr. Cartman, did you or did you not tell students at this school that Kyle runs Hollywood?
"
26,1,Cartman,"I think... I did say that, yes.
"
26,1,PC Principal,"And why would you say such an intolerant, offensive thing like that?!
"
26,1,Cartman,"Somebody runs Hollywood.
"
26,1,Kyle,"Lots of people run Hollywood!!
"
26,1,Cartman,"Yes, lots of... people like Kyle.
"
26,1,PC Principal,"Mr. Cartman, you are on dangerous frickin ground here, buddy!
"
26,1,Cartman,"I'm sorry, why is it so offensive to say who runs Hollywood? People like Hollywood. Hollywood's cool. The Jews should be honored to be in charge of it.
"
26,1,PC Principal,"Hey! I am telling you right now, Eric. The next time anyone says anything about Kyle running Hollywood, that person is gonna have two months detention!
"
26,1,Cartman,"Two months?! Jesus, Mary mother full of grace... You guys really take this seriously.
"
26,1,Cartman,"Please help me be the best Christian I can be. All I want is to help people, but nobody understands. Please, I can't do this alone.
"
26,1,Cupid Ye,"Tee hee hee!
"
26,1,Cartman,"There you are, Cupid Ye!
"
26,1,Cupid Ye,"Sorry, Eric, I was just busy praising our Savior's name in the music studio!
"
26,1,Cartman,"The principal said I can't talk about Kyle running Hollywood anymore, Cupid Ye!
"
26,1,Cupid Ye,"Well, of course, Eric! They're trying to silence you! That's what they do.
"
26,1,Cartman,"Who's ""they""? Oh, right... ""them"".
"
26,1,Cupid Ye,"Tee hee hee! Jews!
"
26,1,Cartman,"But Cupid Ye, I have to get to Tolkien or else Stan is gonna be sad forever!
"
26,1,Cupid Ye,"Okay! I'll help you help your friend however I can. You're such a good Christian, Eric.
"
26,1,Cartman,"Thanks. Just, don't do anything too drastic, okay?
"
26,1,Cupid Ye,"What do you mean?
"
26,1,Cartman,"I dunno, it's just... ever since you changed your name and got all into Jesus, you've been acting a bit bat shit crazy, Cupid Ye.
"
26,1,Cupid Ye,"Tee hee hee! Don't worry, Eric! I'm gonna make everything better! 
"
26,1,Cupid Ye,"Praiiiise Jesus!
"
26,1,Cupid Ye,"Tee hee! Tee hee hee hee hee!  The true Jews of Israel are your Black ancestors... Tee hee hee...
"
26,1,Tolkien," Huh...?
"
26,1,Cupid Ye,"You think you and Kyle make TikToks together? Kyle only cares about money. Tee hee hee...
"
26,1,Tolkien," Mmmm...?
"
26,1,Cupid Ye,"Think about it. Are you really making TikToks together, or is Kyle profiting off of you?
"
26,1,"""Cupid Ye""","It's just like the tribes of Israel. Kyle wants to take all the credit for what you're doing.
"
26,1,Steve,"Tolkien?
"
26,1,Cartman,"Oh, Jesus!
"
26,1,Kyle,"Hey, I didn't see you at the playground. Thought we were doing that morning TikTok.
"
26,1,Tolkien,"Oh yeah, sorry. I didn't get the best sleep last night.
"
26,1,Kyle,"Everything okay?
"
26,1,Jimmy,"Hey, Kyle! How's it going, man?
"
26,1,Kyle,"Good, Jimmy. How are you?
"
26,1,Jimmy,"Great! F-F-Fantastic!
"
26,1,Kyle,"Is there something you wanted, Jimmy?
"
26,1,Jimmy,"Oh, yeah! I just realized I've never given you my headshot!  You know, just in case anything ever comes up.
"
26,1,Kyle,"Anything like what?
"
26,1,Jimmy,"Anything like... Anything you might need my headshot for.
"
26,1,Kyle," Jimmy, I do not run Hollywood!
"
26,1,Jimmy,"Well, that's not what everyone's saying.
"
26,1,Kyle," Everyone! I do not run Hollywood! Get a fucking clue!
"
26,1,Kyle,"God dammit! This thing has gotten out of control!
"
26,1,Tolkien,"Ah, it's not a big deal.
"
26,1,Kyle,"It's a huge deal! It's an attack on my ethnicity, Tolkien! You don't understand!
"
26,1,Tolkien,"I don't understand?
"
26,1,Kyle,"Yeah, Tolkien. There's lots of Black people in the NBA, but nobody says, ""The NBA is run by Black people!""
"
26,1,Tolkien,"That's because the NBA is run by white people!
"
26,1,Kyle,"Okay, yeah good point.
"
26,1,Tolkien,"Look, I'm sorry. You wanna just go make that morning TikTok?
"
26,1,Kyle,"Yeah, sure. We still have time.
"
26,1,Tolkien,"Cool, come on!
"
26,1,Cartman,"Stan? Sometimes, Jesus works slowly.
"
26,1,Stan,"Stop talking to me. 
"
26,1,Randy,"Hey, Ger. You got a minute to talk?
"
26,1,Gerald,"Yeah, what's up, Randy?
"
26,1,Randy,"Look, I - I know that boys will be boys and as parents, we can't always control what their personal decisions are.
"
26,1,Gerald,"No, of course not.
"
26,1,Randy,"I just want you to know first off that... your son is a great kid. You know, Stan and Kyle have always been really close, and I know their friendship meant so much.
"
26,1,Gerald,"What's happened, Randy?
"
26,1,Randy," Well Gerald, I don’t know if you can just talk to your son but… can we just admit this whole woke thing isn’t working?
"
26,1,Gerald,"Woke thing?
"
26,1,Randy,"I mean, it’s been great in so many ways, but… now it’s like every movie and every TV show. You know it’s like you can see through it now. Audiences want to be entertained. They don’t want to be preached at, and if you’re just doing shows and movies that have an agenda, it’s like-- it’s just going to keep failing.
"
26,1,Gerald,"Randy, what are you talking about?
"
26,1,Randy,"Box office is down, people are tuning out. You know it’s what killed the Marvel franchise. And just as a side note, I’m gonna say it out loud: “Avatar 2” sucked. It just sucked, Gerald. Someone had to be brave enough to say it.
"
26,1,Kyle,"God dammit! I do not fucking run Hollywood!
"
26,1,Randy,"Gerald, can you talk to him?
"
26,1,Gerald,"Kyle, what is he talking about?
"
26,1,Kyle,"He’s just being an idiot and listening to what fucking Eric Cartman said!
"
26,1,Randy,"I did not hear it from Eric Cartman. I heard it from a prominent, respected artist on television.
"
26,1,Kyle,"Who?!
"
26,1,News Anchor,"Our next guest is a world famous rapper and artist who claims that the Jews run Hollywood. What exactly do you mean by that?
"
26,1,Cartman,"Well, mostly I just mean that Jews control everything we see on TV and the movies.
"
26,1,News Anchor,"And why do you not want to show your face right now?
"
26,1,Cartman,"Well, that’s ‘cause there’s this one Jew -- um, his name is Kyle. And he can totally retaliate me, ‘cause he like, runs Hollywood.
"
26,1,Cupid Ye," Yeah, and Jews try to silence people all the time. Yeah, especially black people.
"
26,1,Cartman,"Yeah, especially black people.
"
26,1,Cartman," That’s because of all the new information lately. The new information about how the chosen people were actually Africans.
"
26,1,Cartman," So, you know, black people have really been hurt by the Jews.
"
26,1,Cupid Ye,"Yeah, so Hitler actually wasn’t a bad guy.
"
26,1,Cartman,"Yeah, so-- woah, woah, Cupid Ye. That’s going a bit too far. He’s just trying to be shocking.
"
26,1,Linda," What are you watching, honey?
"
26,1,Tolkien,"I have no idea.
"
26,1,Tolkien,"
Mommy?


"
26,1,Kyle,"
What is it, Caillou?


"
26,1,Tolkien,"
Can I get Roblox on my Xbox?


"
26,1,Kyle,"
Sure thing, Caillou, as long as it’s free.


"
26,1,Tolkien,"
Oh for sure it is for free.


"
26,1,Kyle,"Okay, wait, wait, cut. Hang on.  Let’s try again. I think you forgot the words.
"
26,1,Tolkien,"Yeah, sorry. I’m just tired. I didn’t get the best sleep last night. Maybe I should do the mom part.
"
26,1,Kyle,"Nah, you do the kid part. It’s funnier.
"
26,1,Tolkien,"Okay, yeah. I guess you call the shots.
"
26,1,Kyle,"What’s that supposed to mean?
"
26,1,Tolkien,"Just means you’re in charge.
"
26,1,Kyle,"Oh, I’m in charge. Like I, control things? Huh, are you gonna start saying I run Hollywood now too?
"
26,1,Tolkien,"I didn’t say you run Hollywood And honestly, I’m getting kind of sick of hearing it.
"
26,1,Kyle,"You’re sick of hearing it?
"
26,1,Tolkien,"Yeah, I’m sick of hearing it.
"
26,1,Kyle," Oh my God, are you listening to yourself? You of all people should have some compassion!
"
26,1,Tolkien,"Oh, really? Why me of all people, Kyle?
"
26,1,Kyle," You seriously don’t know why? You know that Jews have stood alongside Blacks since the Civil Rights movement began, right?
"
26,1,Tolkien,"What does that have to do with anything?
"
26,1,Kyle,"I’m just saying I thought you’d be a better friend. ‘Cause you’re like…
"
26,1,Tolkien,"’Cause I’m like what? Black?
"
26,1,Cartman," Oh my God, this is so awesome.
"
26,1,Kyle,"Whatever, Tolkien. Now you’re gonna act like I somehow did something wrong to you.
"
26,1,Tolkien,"No, you didn’t do it to me. It just seems to work out that way all the time for you people.
"
26,1,Kyle,"You people?! No, it works that way for you people!
"
26,1,Tolkien,"You know what? I don’t wanna make TikToks with you anymore! 
"
26,1,Kyle," I don’t wanna make TikToks with you anymore!
"
26,1,Tolkien,"Good!
"
26,1,Kyle,"Good!
"
26,1,Cartman," We did it. I can’t believe we did it!
"
26,1,Cupid Ye,"Praise Christ! They’ll probably never talk again!
"
26,1,Cartman,"And now Stan can have his best friend back.
"
26,1,Cupid Ye,"Yeah! And we can spread our Nazi message all over the world!
"
26,1,Cartman,"Woah, woah, okay. Cupid Ye, you mean our Christian message.
"
26,1,Cupid Ye,"It’s the same thing! Christian message, Nazi message. Hitler was a great Christian!
"
26,1,Cartman,"Cupid Ye, are you okay? Do you need to, like, talk to somebody?
"
26,1,Cupid Ye,"I mean it! People have to die so that the better races can live.
"
26,1,Cartman,"Okay, Cupid Ye, time to go back inside.
"
26,1,Cupid Ye," Teehee, teeheehee, tee hee hee.
"
26,1,Cartman,"C’mon, let’s go, Ye!
"
26,1,Cupid Ye,"I don’t think so, dawg! Let’s go torch some motherfuckers!
"
26,1,Cupid Ye,"Dethcon one, bitches!
"
26,1,Cartman,"Yeeeee! 
"
26,1,Cartman,"Yeeeeeeeeee! Oh, shit.
"
26,1,Stan,"Yeah?
"
26,1,Cartman," Stan! We aren’t safe!
"
26,1,Stan,"What?!
"
26,1,Cartman," He’s totally gotten crazy! I don’t think I can reason with him anymore!
"
26,1,Stan,"Reason with who?
"
26,1,Cartman,"Stan, listen to me. There’s someone who’s been messing with Kyle and Tolkien. He said it was to be a good Christian, but… But I think he’s just been using Christianity as an excuse to be a racist piece of shit.
"
26,1,Stan,"What did you do?
"
26,1,Cartman,"Not me, Stan! This is going to be extremely hard to believe, but… There’s a little magic angel that comes each year around Valentine’s Day. He spreads love and brings lonely people together. But this year is different. Cupid Me found Christ and changed his name. And I have to find a way to get him back on his meds.
"
26,1,Stan,"Dude, Cartman, are you okay? Do you need to, like, talk to somebody?
"
26,1,Cartman,"Stan, do you believe in Santa Claus?
"
26,1,Stan," Yeah.
"
26,1,Cartman,"Do you believe in the Easter Bunny?
"
26,1,Stan," I guess so.
"
26,1,Cartman,"Then believe that tomorrow is Valentine’s Day… and there’s no telling what Cupid Ye is capable of.
"
26,1,Butters," Happy Valentine’s Day, Clyde! Here’s a Valentine for you, Red!
"
26,1,Mr. Mackey," Ah, Valentine’s Day. Isn’t it nice? Love is in the air!
"
26,1,Cupid Ye,"
Dee deet, deedle-y doo! I ain’t sayin’ she a gold digger! But she ain’t messin’ with no broke Jew!

 Who is it? Teehee.
"
26,1,Craig,"Hey! Asshole! Other people need to use the bathroom too!
"
26,1,Craig," Woah… dude…
"
26,1,Cupid Ye,"Happy Valentine’s Day, bitch!
"
26,1,Craig,"What the hell?!
"
26,1,Cupid Ye,"How about a little antisemitism?!
"
26,1,Craig," Ugh! 
"
26,1,Kenny,"(Aaaaghagaah!!!) 
"
26,1,Cupid Ye,"Teehee Tehehehe.
"
26,1,Cupid Ye,"Teehee Teeheehee Teeheehee.
"
26,1,Girl 1,"What is that?!
"
26,1,Stan," Tolkien! Tolkien I need to talk to you.
"
26,1,Tolkien,"About what?
"
26,1,Stan,"Tolkien…  I owe you an apology. Someone has been messing with you… and it was all for me.
"
26,1,Tolkien,"I don’t get it.
"
26,1,Stan,"I’ve been jealous about you and Kyle’s TikToks. 
"
26,1,Cupid Ye,"Teehee Teeheehee.
"
26,1,Mr. Mackey," Attention students! There is a giant bee in the school! Get somewhere safe! There’s a giant bee! Oh, Jesus, here it is!
"
26,1,Cupid Ye," Teeheehee Teeheehee.
"
26,1,Mr. Mackey," Oh, God, it’s a bee!
"
26,1,Craig," Look, there he is!
"
26,1,Kevin,"What do you think you’re doing, Kyle?
"
26,1,Kyle,"W-What do you mean?
"
26,1,Craig,"A “Lord of the Rings” prequel?! What were you thinking?!
"
26,1,Kevin,"How many more superheroes do you think we need?!
"
26,1,Butters,"Mario Brothers, Kyle?! You seriously can’t do better than Mario Brothers?!
"
26,1,Tolkien," That’s enough, you guys!
"
26,1,Kyle,"Tolkien?
"
26,1,Tolkien,"I’m sorry, Kyle.
"
26,1,Stan,"It’s not his fault, it’s mine. I was jealous of you guys and your TikToks.
"
26,1,Cupid Ye," What are you waiting for?! Let’s jack up these mofos!
"
26,1,Kyle,"Holy shit!
"
26,1,Tolkien,"What the hell is that?!
"
26,1,Cartman," Cupid Yeeeeee!!  Time to take your meds.
"
26,1,Cupid Ye,"No! Those are how people control me!
"
26,1,Cartman," You’re taking your meds, Ye! One way or another! 
"
26,1,Cupid Ye," No! I’m not taking!--
"
26,1,Cartman,"You’re taking your medication! 
"
26,1,Cupid Ye,"Let me go, I’m not t--
"
26,1,Cartman,"You’re taking it, Ye!  Swallow it, swallow it! Swallow it, swallow it!  Ye? Ye?
"
26,1,Cupid Me,"Eric?
"
26,1,Cartman,"Cupid Me?! You guys! It's Cupid Me! He’s back!
"
26,1,Cupid Me," What day is it?
"
26,1,Cartman,"Why, it’s Valentine’s Day, Cupid Me!
"
26,1,Cupid Me,"Valentine's Day?! Well then I need to get to work!  Teeheehee Teeheehee!
"
26,1,Cartman," Yeah!
"
26,1,Conference Woman,"We have a young man who is joining us here today to… talk about stereotypes and the harm that they can bring. Young man, what is your message.
"
26,1,Kyle,"My message is, we can't control what people say, so we have to be smart about what we choose to believe. If one idiot says that a certain group ""runs Hollywood"", look into it. With very minimal effort, you will find that ""Hollywood"" is a multi-tiered industry run by tens of thousands of people from all over the world. In the past, Jews were shut out of most professions, so they came to dominate vaudeville, which back then was considered too low-brow for good Christians. Those Jews eventually moved West and started the first movie studios when movies were also considered work for the underclass, and their descendents are now a decent percentage of the thousands of people of all races that make Hollywood run.
"
26,1,Conference Man 1,"This young man has said in plain words what so many of us in Hollywood have been trying to get people to understand.
"
26,1,Older Man 1,"To hear it all so plain, and so passionate, this kid thinks about things the way we all need to.
"
26,1,Conference Man 2,"You know what I think? I think this kid should run Hollywood!
"
26,1,Conference Man 3,"Yeah! 
"
26,1,Kyle,"Woah, woah-- wait, what? Woah.
"
26,1,Conference Man 1,"Let him run Hollywood!
"
26,1,Conference Man 2,"Yeah, give the kid a chance! C’mon!
"
26,1,Conference Man 4,"Let him do it!
"
26,1,Kyle,"God dammit!
"
26,1,Crowd," Let the Jew run it! Let the Jew run it! Let the Jew run it! Let the Jew run it!
"
26,2,Announcer,"Today is a tragic day for Canada. Thousands of Canadians have gathered to mourn the passing of their beloved mother. The Queen is dead.
"
26,2,Announcer,"Every Canadian everywhere is feeling absolute emptiness right now. And now the casket is brought down the aisle with the Queen inside. The Queen's body being carried by the royal guard. What a horrible day for Canada and therefore the world.
"
26,2,Kyle,"Ike -- Ike, come on, dude, you can't keep doing this.
"
26,2,Ike,"She's dead. She's dead, Kyle.
"
26,2,Kyle,"Ike, the Queen died like four months ago. You gotta let it go.
"
26,2,Announcer,"And here comes Canada's most beloved musician, Sir Smelly John.  Yes, Smelly John is sitting down at the piano with a tribute for the Queen, I believe.
"
26,2,Sir Smelly John,"
Goodbye, queefy Queen
Seems as though you've queefed your last queef...




"
26,2,Kyle,"Okay, it's 7:00, it's my turn to use the computer.
"
26,2,Ike,"No!
"
26,2,Kyle,"Ike, me and my friends are playing ""Darktide"" right now. Get off!
"
26,2,Ike,"Fuck you, Kyle! 
"
26,2,Announcer,"Oh, and now people are starting to stare angrily. Y-Yes, it looks like the Prince and his new wife have just shown up.  The Prince and his wife have, of course, been bashing the Canadian monarchy. A lot of Canadians hate them now.  Oh, and I believe the Earl of Halifax has just farted on the Prince's wife's face! The Prince seems to have taken offense to this. Oh, this is bad now.
"
26,2,Kyle,"Ike, I'm playing ""Darktide"" with my friends!
"
26,2,Ike,"No, get off me!
"
26,2,Kyle,"Ike, goddamn it, get off!!
"
26,2,Kyle,"Hey, guys.
"
26,2,Stan,"Kyle, dude, where were you last night?
"
26,2,Cartman,"Yeah, we were all waiting.
"
26,2,Kyle,"Look, I know you think I haven't been showing up for things, but -- but I got screwed by my little brother. He just keeps crying about the Queen. And then there's this Prince and his wife and they're bashing the Canadian monarchy.  I guess it's like people don't even know why they showed up to the funeral. But anyway, I'm really sorry I ruined game time for everyone.
"
26,2,Cartman,"You didn't ruin it for anyone. We played without you.
"
26,2,Kyle,"What? Y-You guys, we -- we said we'd all level up together.
"
26,2,Stan,"Well, yeah, we're all like level 12 now.
"
26,2,Cartman,"We got some sweet drip, dude.
"
26,2,Kenny,"(Sweet drip, dude!)
"
26,2,Kyle,"But this isn't fair, it wasn't my fault.
"
26,2,Tolkien,"Hey guys. Did you get to upgrade your gun, Stan?
"
26,2,Stan,"Yeah, it's got a lot better range now. What about you? 
"
26,2,Tolkien,"I kept the same gun, but I got some sweet drip. 
"
26,2,Cartman,"Nice, sweet drip, dude!
"
26,2,Kenny,"(Haha, yeah, sweet drip, dude.)
"
26,2,Butters,"It stinks, doesn't it?
"
26,2,Kyle,"What stinks?
"
26,2,Butters,"When people make certain judgements about you. I've been watching you, Kyle, and I can see your having some problems with your brand.
"
26,2,Kyle," My brand?
"
26,2,Butters,"You see, everyone has an image, Kyle. Some kids call it your credibility, or your reputation, but those things are just little parts of something much more important -- your brand. Think about it, Kyle. Who are you?
"
26,2,Kyle,"I'm just -- I-I'm just me.
"
26,2,Butters,"See? You don't know what your brand is. So how is anyone else supposed to know? It's like a commercial for Kyle, but you're not putting a label on the jar.
"
26,2,Kyle,"Butters, this seems very out of character for you.
"
26,2,Butters,"That's because I've been workin' on my brand. My parents saw that my brand wasn't working with people, so they sent me to brand management.
"
26,2,Kyle,"Brand management?
"
26,2,Butters,"Hi, Mr. Davis!
"
26,2,Mr. Davis,"Well, Butters Stotch. How you doing there, Butters? How's the brand going?
"
26,2,Butters,"Great! I made two friends, and a girl asked me to help her with her homework.
"
26,2,Mr. Davis,"Well, there ya go there, Butters.
"
26,2,Butters,"My friend Kyle here was thinking of reworking his brand a bit, and I told him maybe you could help.
"
26,2,Mr. Davis,"Oh, well, sure there, Kyle, let's just get you to fill out a CumHammer survey, and then we'll go in the back and come up with some options for ya.
"
26,2,Announcer,"Live, from the television studios in Toronto, it's ""Good Morning, Canada!"" 
"
26,2,Host,"It has been several months since our beloved Queen has died. All Canadians are finding it hard to go on. All Canadians, that is, except for our first guests, The Prince and his wife.
"
26,2,Prince and Princess,"We want privacy! We want privacy!
"
26,2,Prince,"Thanks for having us in the show. 
"
26,2,Princess,"It's so awesome to be here. It's great.
"
26,2,Host,"So let me start with you, sir. You lived a life with the royal family, you had everything handed to you, but you say your life has been hard, and you've written all aboot it in your new book, ""Waaagh.""
"
26,2,Prince,"Yes that's right, fwiend. You see, my wife and I are --
"
26,2,Princess,"I was totally like, ""You should write a book 'cause your family's, like, stupid, and then so are, like, journalists.""
"
26,2,Host,"So you hate journalists?
"
26,2,Prince,"That's right!
"
26,2,Host,"And now you wrote a book that reports on the lives of the royal family.
"
26,2,Prince,"Right.
"
26,2,Host,"So you're a journalist.
"
26,2,Princess,"We just want to be normal people. All this attention is so hard.
"
26,2,Host,"Isn't it true, sir, that your questionable wife has her own TV show and hangs out with celebrities and does fashion magazines?
"
26,2,Prince,"What are you suggesting?
"
26,2,Host,"Well, I just think some people might say that your Instagram-loving bitch wife actually doesn't want her privacy?
"
26,2,Prince,"How dare you, sir! My Instagram-loving bitch wife has always wanted her privacy! And you know what else? To hell with Canada! We are leaving! We'll go find some quiet place where we can be normal people! Come on, wife.
"
26,2,Prince and Princess,"We want privacy! We want privacy!

"
26,2,Mr. Davis,"Alright there, Kyle, we got your survey answers, and I think we've put together some great ideas for your brand. I want understand you want people to like you more and think you're cool. Is that right?
"
26,2,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
26,2,Mr. Davis,"Alright, well, let's see how this brand works for you. We got... Kyle -- Rugged. Vegan. Compassionate. Victim.
"
26,2,Kyle,"I-I don't think that's really me.
"
26,2,Mr. Davis,"Well, that's fine 'cause there's a lot of different brands people are attracted to. How about this one?  Kyle -- Senstitive. Outdoorsy. Frugal. Victim.
"
26,2,Kyle,"I'm not -- I'm not that outdoorsy.
"
26,2,Mr. Davis,"Okay, well, remember there, Kyle, it's not so much about who you are as much as it is about what people are attracted to, okay? So, let's see, how about this?  Kyle -- Wealthy. Handsome. Multi-talented Grammy Award-Winning. Victim. Oh, that -- that one's taken already. Sorry. Hold on.  Just a minute, Kyle. We're gonna find a good one here for you.
"
26,2,Butters,"You'll see, Kyle. When you have your brand up and runnin', no one can stop you.
"
26,2,Princess,"Look at this town. There's just something about it. Oh, darling. I think this might be the place.
"
26,2,Prince,"You really think so?
"
26,2,Princess,"It's so quiet and empty here. If we moved here, then people would think we're really serious about wanting to be normal.
"
26,2,Prince,"It does seem perfect, doesn't it? We can have a fresh start here. Lead a normal life and have babies.
"
26,2,Princess,"Can we? Can we really move here and finally have our privacy?
"
26,2,Prince,"My love, I will do anything for your privacy.
"
26,2,Prince,"The couch goes in the first room! Ay, be careful with that TV, buddy! Drum set goes on the second floor.  Wait, put it down. I want to make sure it isn't damaged.
"
26,2,Kyle,"What the hell?
"
26,2,Prince," Hey! Hey, you! Hey, what are you looking at?! You ever heard of privacy?!
"
26,2,Kyle,"What?
"
26,2,Kyle,"You guys, I am so sorry. I totally was going to play with you guys online but the Prince of Canada and his wife moved in across the street from me. They have this huge jet parked in front of my house and then they kept trying to get me to buy their stupid book and -- and, anyway, I'm sorry I messed up another game night.
"
26,2,Stan,"It's okay, dude, we had a great time.
"
26,2,Cartman,"Yeah, we are literally dripping with drip.
"
26,2,Kyle,"Well, I just want you guys to know that I am a reliable, fun-loving, punctual victim.
"
26,2,Stan,"...'Kay, well, we gotta get to class.
"
26,2,Kyle,"I'm really working on myself! You're gonna like what you see! 
"
26,2,Mr. Davis,"As a child, you see the world in a different way. You see the wonder in nature, and you're starting to learn more about yourself, all the time. And you're learning that there's something more important than you ever thought -- your brand. It's what defines you. And with brand management, you can make sure others see you the way they want to see you.
"
26,2,Mr. Davis,"Welcome to your CumHammer Work tutorial. You are taking the first steps to making your brand a great one.
"
26,2,Mr. Davis," By now you've received your workbook and also your brand slide tool and CumHammer social-media drive which will be used in this video. Now, if you're ready, let's start the exercises on page five of your workbook.
"
26,2,Prince,"Respect our privacy!
"
26,2,Princess,"Leave us alone! Leave us alone!
"
26,2,Prince and Princess,"Down with the monarchy! We just want our privacy!
"
26,2,Kyle,"God, fuck these people!
"
26,2,Princess,"Why are we so mad today?
"
26,2,Prince,"Because we want our privacy!
"
26,2,Officer,"Park County Police Station. What's your emergency?
"
26,2,Kyle,"Yeah, the neighbors across the steet are setting off fireworks and it's 10:30 at night!
"
26,2,Officer,"Oh, is it the Prince of Canada and his wife, who just want to be left alone?
"
26,2,Kyle,"Yes. They're being super loud, and I'm trying to work on my brand!  Oh, god damn it. Now, the Prince is playing polo on the lawn!
"
26,2,Princess,"We are here because privacy is a basic human right. How many more princes and his wives have to live in this nightmare?
"
26,2,Kyle,"Hey, can you two fucking keep it down?!
"
26,2,Prince,"Oy! You ever heard of a thing called ""privacy""?!
"
26,2,Kyle,"Yeah, nobody gives a shit! Will you two just shut up, and go away?! 
"
26,2,Kyle,"It seriously is driving me crazy! The prince plays drums all day. I don't think he even has a job. And I don't know what the hell she does. Why they even left Canada is beyond me. And, like, she seems to just boss him around, and make him do whatever she wants. I mean, why did they even leave Canada and move to South Park, anyway?
"
26,2,Cartman,"Stan, are you gonna say something?
"
26,2,Stan,"You say it.
"
26,2,Kyle,"Say what?
"
26,2,Stan,"Look, Kyle... We just kinda don't care about some dumb prince and his stupid wife.
"
26,2,Kyle,"I don't care about them either!
"
26,2,Jimmy,"So, then why do you talk about them all the time?
"
26,2,Kyle,"
"
26,2,Stan,"Dude, we're just kind of sick of hearing about them.
"
26,2,Kyle,"I'm sick of hearing about them! But I can't get away from them! They're everywhere! In my fucking face!
"
26,2,Tolkien,"Yeah, and now you're putting 'em in our fucking face.
"
26,2,Kyle,"Fine, I won't talk about them anymore.
"
26,2,Cartman,"Thank you.
"
26,2,Kyle,"Ok, just one last thing -- did you know the Prince sleeps-
"
26,2,Kyle,"I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
"
26,2,Mr. Davis,"The problem with you is you want results without the work. You can't just say you're a certain thing, and then expect people to just like your brand. You gotta work it, sell people on it.
"
26,2,Kyle,"But I just don't feel like my brand is who I really am on the inside.
"
26,2,Mr. Davis,"You know, Kyle, some people think it's what's inside you that matters. But people can't see inside you. They can only see what kind of drink you're drinking. That's what matters.
"
26,2,Kyle,"I guess so.
"
26,2,Mr. Davis,"Now, I'm gonna help you with a new brand, but you've got to work on it. What do you want your friends to think about you?
"
26,2,Kyle,"I want them to think I'm not gonna complain about things. I'm more thick-skinned.
"
26,2,Mr. Davis," Okay. This is good. This is good...
"
26,2,Kyle,"And I want people to think I'm stronger, mentally, than I probably already am.
"
26,2,Mr. Davis,"Okay. Okay. I think I got it. People are gonna love this. Kyle -- he's a thick-skinned, super cool, nothing bothers him victim.
"
26,2,Kyle,"I just don't know if I can--
"
26,2,Mr. Davis," You're goin' off brand already! Remember, no matter what, nothing bothers you.
"
26,2,Kyle,"I don't care. Don't care. 
"
26,2,Prince,"What the hell?
"
26,2,Princess,"What'd he just say? He victimized me! It's because I'm an ethnic woman!
"
26,2,Prince,"He can't do that! I'll see -- Wait, you're ethnic? This is an outrage! We'll just see how he deals with my blue penis!
"
26,2,Prince,"Hey! Have some respect for this privacy!
"
26,2,Prince,"Don't worry, my love, he's not gonna get away with this.
"
26,2,Kyle,"Hey, guys! How you doin?!
"
26,2,Stan," Good. How are you?
"
26,2,Kyle,"I'm great! Got some good sleep last night. Just letting things roll right off my back, you know? 'Cause that's the kind of guy I am.
"
26,2,Cartman," Cool.
"
26,2,Kyle,"Hey, you guys want to play ""Darktide"" after school? Or if not, whatever. I'm cool either way.
"
26,2,Stan,"Yeah, I'm sure we can figure that out.
"
26,2,Kyle,"Cool, whatever. I'm care-free and unflappable. I'll catch you guys at lunch! 
"
26,2,Jimmy,"Wow, Kyle, you seem really different.
"
26,2,Kyle,"Do you like it?
"
26,2,Jimmy,"Uh, sure.
"
26,2,Kyle,"Thanks, Jimmy. But you know, I really need to thank a good friend. He introduced me to a way of becoming a more stable person. Have you seen Butters?
"
26,2,Jimmy,"Butters? Oh, sure. He's out on the playground, getting the shit beat of out him by Bebe.
"
26,2,Kyle,"What?!
"
26,2,Bebe,"Mother!  Fucker! Don't ever say that shit again!
"
26,2,Kyle,"Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa. What the hell is going on?!
"
26,2,Bebe,"I wasn't even doing anything, and he came up, and started talking shit to me!
"
26,2,Butters,"Yeah, everyone likes a guy that's strong and assertive, so I told Bebe to go fuck herself.
"
26,2,Bebe,"Who do you even think you are?!
"
26,2,Butters,"You want some more of this, you dumb slut?!
"
26,2,Kyle,"Butters, what are you doing?! This isn't you.
"
26,2,Butters,"Hey, Kyle, will you relax? You're kind of fucking up my brand.
"
26,2,Kyle,"Okay, that does it -- come on, Butters. You're going back to CumHammer.
"
26,2,Bebe,"You're lucky he saved your ass!
"
26,2,Butters,"Fuck you, you fucking bitch!
"
26,2,Mr. Davis,"The most important thing about your brand is being flexible. We want to make sure you're completely satisfied. You say you're having some problems?
"
26,2,Prince of Canada,"That's right! There's this horrible spy who lives across the street from us, and we're gonna get him back by changing our brand!
"
26,2,Mr. Davis,"All right. And I do see you're in our database, but you didn't first get help at this CumHammer location?
"
26,2,Prince,"No. My wife went to one in California as a child.
"
26,2,Mr. Davis,"Ah, okay. Then you must be in the national system. Oh, yeah. Is this you? ""Sorority girl, Actress, Influencer, Victim.""
"
26,2,Princess,"Yeah. That's totally me.
"
26,2,Mr. Davis,"Okay, I see. And then, you added your husband to your Friends and Family account. You must be the, ""Royal prince, millionaire, world traveler, victim.""
"
26,2,Prince,"That's right.
"
26,2,Kyle,"Come on, Butters. Hello?
"
26,2,Mr. Davis,"Oh, hey there! Just gimme a minute. I'm with some other clients right now, there, Kyle.
"
26,2,Kyle,"Uh, no. This is an emergency. We need to talk to --
"
26,2,Prince,"Oy! Do you mind! Stop invading --  It's him!
"
26,2,Princess,"
"
26,2,Kyle,"What the hell are you doing here?!
"
26,2,Prince,"You just can't leave us alone, can't you!
"
26,2,Princess,"Oh my God, he is so obsessed with us!
"
26,2,Kyle,"I'm not obsessed with you! It's this stupid place! Don't you see, Butters? Teaching people to think of their brand just makes people more like them. This whole thing is wrong. They're telling you guys to reduce yourselves into products instead of people to be truly understood and loved. Don't you guys want people to like you for you instead of who they want you to be? Look, we all have our faults. God knows I do. But if we just try to present and control an image of us for people to see, then, we're just performers instead of human beings.
"
26,2,Prince,"He's right. Trying to make ourselves into a brand just turned us into products. We don't need to be a brand, do we? If it's truly what we want, then we really can get away from it all. No more magazines and Netflix shows. We really can live a normal life.  Yes, I'm sure you agree darling. We can be the people we talked about being, with no more worries about how we look or the image with project to people. What matters is what we have on the inside.
"
26,2,Prince," Hello?
"
26,2,Kyle,"Come on, Butters. Time to go home.
"
26,2,Butters,"Yeah.
"
26,2,A Girl,"Yeah.
"
26,2,A Boy,"Yeah...
"
26,2,Mr. Davis,"Now, hey. Don't make a decision you might all regret.
"
26,2,Prince,"Yeah, come on, honey. We don't need this place.  Honey?
"
26,2,Reporter,"The Queen is dead. What a sad day for Canada -- and therefore, the world.
"
26,2,Ike,"
"
26,2,Kyle,"Ike, I need to use the -- Oh no, not again...
"
26,2,Ike,"She's still dead.
"
26,2,Kyle,"Ike, I have to get on the computer. The Queen's been dead a long time.  Ike! I have to get on with my friends! If I don't, they're gonna think I'm...
"
26,2,Kyle,"It's okay. Things get to you. It's who you are.
"
26,2,Kyle,"Oh. Hey, guys.
"
26,2,Stan,"Hey, dude. Uh... We thought maybe you could do with a little outside time.
"
26,2,Kyle,"Really?
"
26,2,Tolkien,"We just thought it'd be good to get you out of the house. You seem to be going through a lot lately.
"
26,2,Kyle,"Yeah. Yeah, I have.  Thanks, guys. I'd love to play.
"
26,2,Prince,"Oy! Oy! Could, uh... Could I play?
"
26,2,Stan,"Sure, you can play.
"
26,2,Prince,"Great!
"
26,3,Randy,"See, Stan? You gotta choose if you wanna be in Gryffindor or Slytherin.
"
26,3,Stan,"Yeah, can I do it?
"
26,3,Randy,"Yeah, see, you gotta fight these fairy guys. 
"
26,3,Sharon,"Randy.  Randy! The powder room toilet is broken. Again!
"
26,3,Randy,"Did you jiggle the handle?
"
26,3,Sharon,"Yes, I jiggled the handle. Will you come fix this, please?
"
26,3,Randy,"Okay, okay...
"
26,3,Randy,"Huh, well, let's see. It's gotta be the little black floaty thingie. What'd you do to it?
"
26,3,Sharon,"I didn't do anything.
"
26,3,Randy,"Lemme see if there's water in the bowl.
"
26,3,Sharon,"No! Don't lift the lid!
"
26,3,Randy,"Why can't I lift the lid?
"
26,3,Sharon,"Don't, Randy!
"
26,3,Randy,"Uh-huh... Hey, guys! Your mom took a shit and doesn't want me to see it.
"
26,3,Stan," Ew!
"
26,3,Shelly," Gross, Dad!
"
26,3,Sharon,"Randy! We need to get a new toilet.
"
26,3,Randy,"We can't just get rid of 'ol blue, Sharon.
"
26,3,Sharon,"This is embarrassing. It's the powder room toilet, the one guests use. You get a new toilet, Randy, or I'm not helping you sell weed anymore! 
"
26,3,Randy,"Alright, alright. Sharon, you win. As usual. Poor 'ol blue...
"
26,3,Home Depot Employee,"Can I help you with anything?
"
26,3,Randy,"Oh, yeah, just lookin' for a new toilet to replace Ol' Blue.
"
26,3,Home Depot Employee,"Alright, well, all our toilets here are standard bowl, come with full warranty. How much you looking to spend?
"
26,3,Randy,"Well, I'm not poor. I happen to have my own weed business. So that's pretty much the nicest one you have, right? 
"
26,3,Home Depot Employee,"Yeah, that's probably the top model, you know, before you start getting into Japanese toilets.
"
26,3,Randy,"Japanese toilets?
"
26,3,Home Depot Employee,"Yeah, they're the sort of the super-high-class luxury models with all the bells and whistles. But you probably don't wanna spend that kind of money.
"
26,3,Randy,"I'm not poor.
"
26,3,Home Depot Employee,"Oh, well, we can show them to you. The Japanese toilets are right over there.
"
26,3,Home Depot Employee,"Hi, Rick. This gentleman would like to see the Japanese toilets.
"
26,3,Rick,"Well, of course, sir. My name is Rick. Let me know if there's anything you need.
"
26,3,Home Depot Employee,"These toilets are all equipped with the highest-end features, including an automatic bidet system, bluetooth capability, and seat warmers.
"
26,3,Randy,"Seat warmers?
"
26,3,Home Depot Employee,"Of course. And the toilet sense when you've come into the room, turns on a small light, plays welcome music, and raises the lid for you.
"
26,3,Waitress,"Can I offer you some sparkling water or champagne?
"
26,3,Randy,"Oh, sure, I'll take some champagne.
"
26,3,Home Depot Employee,"All the toilet's functions are operated by a touch-button remote which you mount where the toilet-paper roll used to go.
"
26,3,Randy,"So then where do you keep the toilet paper?
"
26,3,Home Depot Employee,"With a Japanese toilet, you don't need toilet paper. The toilet washes you completely clean.
"
26,3,Randy,"You're mad.
"
26,3,Home Depot Employee,"No, it's true. It has warm water and a dryer and cleans you eight times better than toilet paper can.  Would you like to take one for a test drive?
"
26,3,Randy,"Oh, uh, sure. I did have kind of a big breakfast.
"
26,3,Home Depot Employee,"Right over here.
"
26,3,Randy,"Oh!
"
26,3,Randy,"Whoa! Ooh. Oh, oh! Oh. Ahh! Oh, oh... 
"
26,3,Randy,"Ohh! Oh...  Okay, how much?
"
26,3,Randy,"Guys, I wanted to talk to you because I want you all to think about how we're viewed as a family. You know, as a prominent weed dealer, we are successful, and we're sort of looked up to in this town because we have nice things that most families can't afford. I mean, Stan, you're playing ""Hogwarts Legacy"" on PS5, right?
"
26,3,Stan,"You're playing ""Hogwarts Legacy"" on a PS5.
"
26,3,Randy,"Yeah, my -- my point is that most people in town don't even have a PS5. They still have PS4s, and so we're basically the Kennedys of South Park. And the plain fact is that well-off families have nice things, and we shouldn't be ashamed of that.  Oh! New toilet's here!
"
26,3,Japanese Delivery Man,"Hajimemashite. Japanese Torei des!
"
26,3,Randy,"Uh, yes, thank you. Bring it on in.
"
26,3,Delivery men,"Kyo fun yori! Kro fun yori!
"
26,3,Sharon,"That's the new toilet? How much did it cost?
"
26,3,Randy,"Oh, Sharon. Tennish.
"
26,3,Sharon,"What's ""tennish?""
"
26,3,Randy,"Tennish. Thousandish. Ten Thousandish.
"
26,3,Sharon,"You spent $10,000 on a toilet?! We don't have that kind of money, Randy!
"
26,3,Randy,"Yeah, we do. 
"
26,3,Japanese Delivery Man,"Shitsurei Shimasu! Owarimashita.
"
26,3,Randy,"Okay, yeah, right here?  Okay.
"
26,3,Japanese Delivery Man,"Doomo! Aringanto gozaimashita!
"
26,3,Delivery Men,"Aringanto gozaimashita!
"
26,3,Randy,"'Kay, thanks.
"
26,3,Sharon,"You are taking that back to the store.
"
26,3,Randy,"Try it, Sharon.
"
26,3,Sharon,"I don't need to, Randy. I want --
"
26,3,Randy,"Try it, Sharon!
"
26,3,Sharon,"Oh. Oh...  Oh! Ohhh!
"
26,3,Randy,"Ah-ha-ha!
"
26,3,Stan,"I wanna try it.
"
26,3,Randy,"Shhh!
"
26,3,Sharon," Ah-ho-ho!
"
26,3,Randy,"Ohhh!
"
26,3,Clyde,"Oh, look, there he goes. It's Mr. Big Shot.
"
26,3,Meagan,"Hey, Richie Rich. You eating caviar for lunch today, Richie Rich?
"
26,3,Cartman,"Stan, just so you know, nobody gives a shit.
"
26,3,Stan,"About what?
"
26,3,Cartman,"Come on, guys! 
"
26,3,Betsy,"Did you know some people can't even afford to eat? How about caring for something that matters, you bitch?
"
26,3,Stan,"What the fuck?
"
26,3,Jimmy,"Hey, Stan, you really have to be careful.
"
26,3,Stan,"Of what?
"
26,3,Jimmy,"Look, it's great that you come from a wealthy family, but people don't like getting their noses rubbed in it.
"
26,3,Stan,"Dude, I haven't even said anything!
"
26,3,Jimmy,"Well, your dad called everyone last night and told you have a $10,000 toilet.
"
26,3,Stan,"What?!
"
26,3,Stephen,"Well, thanks for having us over for brunch, Randy.
"
26,3,Linda,"Yeah, what's the special occassion?
"
26,3,Randy,"Oh, you know, just good times with dear friends. Does anyone need to go to the bathroom?
"
26,3,Stephen,"Uh, no, I'm -- I'm good.
"
26,3,Randy,"Oh, maybe some more coffee, then. 
"
26,3,Mrs. Tweak,"Can you guys believe all the snow we've gotten?
"
26,3,Peter,"Yeah, maybe it will actually help with the drought.
"
26,3,Randy,"Let's hope so. Does anyone need a bathroom break?
"
26,3,Stephen,"Well, actually, I-I think I could use the restroom. That was kind of a big breakfast.
"
26,3,Randy,"Oh! Oh, yeah, sure! It's, uh -- It's right across the hallway. Right there.
"
26,3,Stephen,"Excuse me. 
"
26,3,Stephen,"Oh.
"
26,3,Richard,"What was that?
"
26,3,Randy,"Oh, that's the welcome music for my Japanese toilet.
"
26,3,Sheila,"I've heard of those. Aren't they expensive?
"
26,3,Randy,"Yeah, a bit. But for those of us who can afford it, it's well worth it.
"
26,3,Richard," Oh! Ohhh! Ohhhhh!
"
26,3,Randy,"He's now turned on the rear jet, which cleans your bottom with warm water.
"
26,3,Richard,"Oh, ohhhh!
"
26,3,Randy,"Ah! That's the front washer that washes your balls, or vagina.
"
26,3,Richard,"
"
26,3,Randy,"If you think about it, a dry piece of toilet paper can't clean your half as well as pressurized water. I feel that most people have to walk around with fecal matter on their anus, but I'm just lucky I've sold enough weed to be able not to. But was it really luck? Or was it hard work? Heck, I don't know, but you know -- 
"
26,3,Stan,"Dad, can I talk to you?!
"
26,3,Randy,"Stan? You're back from school already?
"
26,3,Stan,"I need to talk to you right now!
"
26,3,Stan,"The fuck are you doing?!
"
26,3,Randy,"The fuck are you doing?
"
26,3,Stan,"You need to stop gloating to everybody!
"
26,3,Randy,"I am not gloating.
"
26,3,Stan,"Yes, you are, and now kids at school are calling me Richie Rich!
"
26,3,Randy,"They are?
"
26,3,Stan,"Nobody cares about your stupid toilet and you're acting like a jerk.
"
26,3,Randy,"You're stupid. I'm acting like a jerk because I'm trying to help people?!
"
26,3,Stan,"How are you trying to help people, Dad?
"
26,3,Randy,"Because the people don't know that these toilets are awesome, and I'm just, like, the well-respected guy who's trying to open people's eyes like JFK.
"
26,3,Stan,"You are not like JFK! You're just showing off!
"
26,3,Randy,"Nu-uh, I'm like JFK 'cause I am trying to change things! You're part of a very respected family, Stan. You should start acting like it.  Okay, who's next?
"
26,3,,"
Atashi wa Heia des-u...


"
26,3,Randy,"Toire ni iru kara...
"
26,3,Sharon," Randy?
"
26,3,Randy,"Kimochi...
"
26,3,Sharon,"Randy!
"
26,3,Randy,"What?!
"
26,3,Sharon,"Your proctologist is here to see you.
"
26,3,Randy,"My protcologist?
"
26,3,Randy,"Oh, hey there, Doc.
"
26,3,Dr. Sheltair,"Well, Randy Marsh, how are ya?
"
26,3,Randy,"I'm doing great. How are you?
"
26,3,Dr. Sheltair,"Wonderful! Just been super busy. I'm actually takin' the wife to Tuscany day after tomorrow.
"
26,3,Randy,"Tuscany? Wow. Awesome.
"
26,3,Dr. Sheltair,"Yeah, well, Randy you haven't been in my office for a few days, so I thought I'd come do a house call to help you with your hemorrhoids.
"
26,3,Randy,"Oh! No, Doctor. I haven't needed to come to your office. In fact, I don't think I'll be needing your services anymore since I've gotten a Japanese toilet.
"
26,3,Dr. Sheltair,"Oh -- Oh, really?
"
26,3,Randy,"It's completely changed my life. I'm healthier, I'm less stressed, and I don't get hemorrhoids 'cause I'm not smearing shit all over my ass with toilet paper.
"
26,3,Dr. Sheltair,"Huh...
"
26,3,Randy,"Here, here. You wanna come see it?!
"
26,3,Randy,"Go on, check it out. 
"
26,3,Randy,"D-Dr. Sheltair?
"
26,3,Randy,"Dr. Sheltair?!
"
26,3,Dr. Sheltair,"You stupid!
"
26,3,Randy,"Whoa hey hey hey!
"
26,3,Dr. Sheltair,"You ruined Tuscany! Gah! 
"
26,3,Randy,"Stop it! 
"
26,3,Dr. Sheltair,"I hate you! I hate you! I hate you!!!
"
26,3,Randy,"Go on! Get out of here!
"
26,3,Dr. Sheltair,"How am I supposed to tell my wife we can't afford to go to Tuscany now?!
"
26,3,Randy,"I never realized you made so much money off my ass. Go on! Get! Get!! 
"
26,3,Butters,"Hey, Stan! Stan hold up!
"
26,3,Stan,"What?
"
26,3,Butters,"Well, um, you're just a really good friend, Stan, and -- and I was gonna ask if maybe I could borrow your plungercost?
"
26,3,Stan,"What's a plungercost?
"
26,3,Butters,"It doesn't cost nothing when your toilet's nice as yours, Richie Rich!  I did it! I called Stan Richie Rich, too! That was fun! 
"
26,3,Jimmy,"Stan, you've got to stop bragging about your toilet.
"
26,3,Stan,"I'm not bragging about my toilet! And why is it such a big deal anyway?
"
26,3,Jimmy,"It's a big deal, Stan. You just don't understand why.
"
26,3,Jimmy,"Have you ever asked yourself why we use toilet paper? We're told to wash our hands... wear masks in crowds... but for some reason when it comes to wiping our ass, we're told to do it with this little piece of paper. We are all -- all of us -- walking around right now with a little bit of shit smeared on our buttholes.  Did you know that 70% of people in the world don't even use it at all?
"
26,3,Stan,"70% of the world doesn't use toilet paper?
"
26,3,Jimmy,"Look it up. Most people in the world still use good 'ol soap and water.
"
26,3,Jimmy,"The average American uses 140 rolls of toilet paper per year. Can you even begin to imagine how many trees that is? To supply the United States its toilet paper, it takes 31.1 million trees per year. A million acres per year of precious Canadian Boreal forest alone, releasing upwards of 25 metric tons of CO2 and leveling 90% of the land barren.
"
26,3,Stan,"So, then, why do Americans use it so much?
"
26,3,Jimmy,"Well, that's the big question, isn't it? None of it makes any sense.
"
26,3,Stan,"Well, then, maybe somebody --
"
26,3,Jimmy,"Just tell your dad to stop. Americans don't want to change their toilets and they never will.
"
26,3,Mayor McDaniels,"Ladies and gentlemen, we have a public service announcement. One of our citizens has asked to speak with you. Please welcome Randy S. Marsh.
"
26,3,Randy,"Thank you, Mayor. Thank you, everyone. You know, the Marshes are a family that try to always lead by example. And we know that all of you appreciate that. Everyone deserves to be clean, and the truth is, you can be. You might not be the Marshes, but you can afford a Japanese toilet. Just not a really nice one like what we have. If you take into account the money we all spend on toilet paper, doctors, and hemorrhoid cream, a Japanese toilet pays for itself in just a few years. There are actually Japanese toilets made for commoners. Walmart and Amazon all carry the lower cost of shitty Japanese toilets that anyone can afford. There's even these like attachment thingies for your existing toilet which will make you feel like a Marsh yourself. They may not be ""Nihon No style-ru"", but they are good enough for you guys. The point is -- even commoners don't need toilet paper anymore! And, so, I am suggesting that this town puts all --
"
26,3,Man,"Holy shit!
"
26,3,Sharon,"Randy?! 
"
26,3,Doctor,"I'm sorry, but he's in critical condition.
"
26,3,Sharon,"Who shot him?
"
26,3,Doctor,"Nobody knows.
"
26,3,Stan,"Is he gonna be okay?
"
26,3,Doctor,"He's in a coma. He's unconscious and just blabbering nonsense.
"
26,3,Randy," Bikkuri... Bikkurishita... Taihen deshou...
"
26,3,Doctor,"Mr. Marsh, your whole family is here. Your wife, your daughter, and your son.
"
26,3,Randy,"T-Toire Wa...?
"
26,3,Doctor,"No, your toilet is back at the farm.
"
26,3,Randy,"Taihen ja naaaa...
"
26,3,Stan,"Dad, I'm sorry I yelled at you before. I didn't know you were really trying to help.
"
26,3,Randy,"Kon-nichi waaa...
"
26,3,Sharon,"Stan, where are you going?
"
26,3,Stan,"I let Dad down once. Somebody has to pick up where he left off. 
"
26,3,Harris,"I promise we're doing all we can. I'm sorry for what happened, but you need to leave it to the professionals.
"
26,3,Stan,"There's something more going on here. I think my dad was on to something and I didn't listen to him, and now he's in a hospital.
"
26,3,Harris,"We've already got a few leads and we're following up on all of them. I assure you we take this all very seriously. This isn't a joke to us.
"
26,3,Officer,"Chief, hey, Chief!
"
26,3,Harris,"Yeah?
"
26,3,Officer,"An angry proctologist walked in to the toilet section of Home Depot.
"
26,3,Harris," Y-Yeah?
"
26,3,Officer,"Proctologist says to the toilet manager, ""I ain't taking the fall,"" and pulls a gun on six Japanese delivery men.
"
26,3,Harris," Okay.
"
26,3,Officer,"So, then, the six Japanese delivery men show up, and the proctologist has everyone held hostage and says he's not taking the fall for the Randy Marsh shooting.
"
26,3,Harris,"Oh, shit, this is actually happening?! Come on people, let's go!
"
26,3,Dr. Sheltair,"I ain't going down for this! You got that, coppers?! I didn't shoot anybody! But if I'm going down, I'll take these careless bastards out with me!
"
26,3,Waitress,"Would you like some sparkling water or cham--
"
26,3,Dr. Sheltair,"Get -- Get outta here! 
"
26,3,Harris," Come on out. There's no other way, we have you surrounded.
"
26,3,Dr. Sheltair,"I didn't shoot Randy Marsh!
"
26,3,Japanese Delivery Man,"Taihen!
"
26,3,Harris,"Nobody's saying you did!
"
26,3,Dr. Sheltair,"No, but they're gonna use me as their scapegoat! They'll fix things like they always do!
"
26,3,Stan,"Who will?
"
26,3,Dr. Sheltair,"They'll use their lawyers and their power to make it all go away! Just like they did back when that second grade kid wrote a story in the school paper about toilets two years ago. They'll take me out too! There's no stopping them.
"
26,3,Harris,"Don't do it!
"
26,3,Japanese Delivery Man,"Sabishiiiii!!
"
26,3,Harris,"Aww! Alright, move in! Secure the area.
"
26,3,Stan,"Second grade kid two years ago... Wrote about toilets in the school news paper.
"
26,3,Stan,"You weren't warning me about people getting upset. You know more about this.
"
26,3,Stan,"Hey!  You wrote a story in the school paper and someone came after you.
"
26,3,Jimmy,"Yeah I wrote a story, big deal!
"
26,3,Stan,"Jimmy, I want to know who shot my dad!
"
26,3,Jimmy,"They took everything from me, Stan! My bike... my cat... They were gonna sue my parents for what I wrote in the school paper.
"
26,3,Stan,"You're talking about the toilet paper companies.
"
26,3,Jimmy,"Who has the most to lose? It's all toilet paper, Stan! Follow the money!
"
26,3,Jimmy,"140 rolls per American per year. Factories pushing out roll after roll while razing Earth's resources. All of this for an unsanitary product that has been proven to contribute to anal fissures.
"
26,3,Jimmy,"Don't you get it, man? Paper doesn't clean bacteria. It can't kill viruses. With all that information, you'd think the world health organization would do studies to find alternatives. So why don't they? Because toilet paper is an industry worth billions and b-billions of dollars. Kimberly-Clark, Georgia-Pacific, Procter & Gamble. They don't want Japanese toilets in America and they have the power to stop them, and to stop you.
"
26,3,Stan,"I can't believe they shot my dad... because he wanted to change things.
"
26,3,Jimmy,"These people have deeper pockets than you can possibly imagine. They can destroy everything you love, Stan. Take my advice... Don't. Squeeze. The Charmin.
"
26,3,Stan,"You might be too scared Jimmy, but I'm a Marsh. 
"
26,3,Stan,"My fellow Americans, we have been coerced and brain washed. While the rest of the world walks around with cleaner buttholes, we are obsessed with dry paper sold to us by billion-dollar corporations.
"
26,3,Man 1,"Yeah.
"
26,3,Man 2,"Hey, yeah, he's right!
"
26,3,Stan,"My father wanted everyone to see that there were alternatives. But they don't want him talking about alternatives.
"
26,3,Crowd,"Yeah!!
"
26,3,Stan,"And we can't be blindly buying their products anymore. And as a town, we will find alternatives, and we will not be afraid to -- 
"
26,3,Randy,"Stop! Stop! We're not doing this!
"
26,3,Stan,"Dad!
"
26,3,Randy,"Everyone just stop, we're not doing this.  Thank you. South Park, uh, we-we're cutting this short. I was totally wrong and I want to apologize.
"
26,3,Stan,"No, dad, it's the toilet paper companies that are behind all the --
"
26,3,Randy,"Yeah, I know.  Yeah, so, uh, we-we have nothing against toilet paper. It's a great product, and uh, it was childish of me to make fun of it. Thanks, though. We'll see ya later.
"
26,3,Stan,"Dad, we can't just back down.
"
26,3,Randy,"Bro! I got fucking shot!  Japanese toilets are totally unnecessary, and, uh, in case anyone else is listening, I think all of South Park would like to apologize.  We retract what we said about toilet paper companies. They -- They have done nothing but help us, and we are sorry.  South Park -- everyone -- say you're sorry.
"
26,3,Crowd,"We're sorry.
"
26,3,Randy,"Okay, great. Come on, guys, let's go home.
"
26,3,Stan,"What about helping people and leading by example?
"
26,3,Randy,"We're not the goddamn Kennedys, Stan. Stop being an idiot.
"
26,3,Randy,"Nice to have you back, Ol' Blue. You know, guys, I'm not actually not that sad. Having a Japanese toilet was great, but... I've come to realize that when you have some big, nice luxury thing, it eventually just becomes normal. But you start comparing it to all the other things in your life which suddenly feel you have to upgrade, too. So, it's really best to just stick with the beat-up, crappy old things we have. Love you forever, honey. 
"
26,4,Bebe,"You guys! You guys, oh my gosh! Oh, my gosh!
"
26,4,Red,"What is it?
"
26,4,Nelly,"What happened, Bebe?
"
26,4,Bebe,"Clyde just sent me another text.
"
26,4,Nichole,"Oh, what's this one say?
"
26,4,Bebe,"I texted him if he thought about me all the time, and he texted back 'it certainly seems like all the time. It's hard to get someone like you out of my mind'.
"
26,4,"Nichole, Betsy, Nelly and Red","Aww!
"
26,4,Bebe,"Doesn't he just send the best texts ever?
"
26,4,Bebe,"Yesterday I texted him How do you know you're in love with me? And he said I know I'm in love with you because spending time with you makes me feel like I'm home, and I can't imagine life without you.
"
26,4,Red,"That's so sweet!
"
26,4,Wendy,"Clyde wrote that?
"
26,4,Bebe,"O.M.G, Clyde, do you really care about me that much?
"
26,4,Red,"Does Stan ever talk to you like that, Wendy?
"
26,4,Wendy,"No... every time I send Stan a text he just responds with a thumbs-up emoji.
"
26,4,Bebe,"Yeah, well, Clyde's just really into me. Oh, he's texting back.
"
26,4,Bebe,"Yes. I do care about you that much. You mean a lot to me and I care deeply about you.
"
26,4,"Nichole, Betsy and Red","Aww!
"
26,4,Betsy,"He sure is in love with you, Bebe!
"
26,4,Red,"He's a goddamn dreamboat!
"
26,4,Bebe,"Yeah, well, Clyde's just really into me. Oh, he's texting back.
"
26,4,Wendy,"Hey, Stan... Is there a time we could talk today? I'm feeling a little insecure about some things...
"
26,4,Stan,"Hey, Clyde, can I talk to you?
"
26,4,Clyde,"Sure, bro.
"
26,4,Stan,"Well, um, Wendy just came up to me and was acting all hurt 'cause she thinks I don't care about her.
"
26,4,Clyde,"Uh-huh.
"
26,4,Stan,"Well, she says that she wishes I would reply to her texts the way that Clyde responds to Bebe so, like, how do you do it?
"
26,4,Clyde,"Chat GPT, dude.
"
26,4,Stan,"Chat GPT?
"
26,4,Clyde,"Yeah, dude. There's a bunch of apps and programs you could subscribe to that use open AI to do all your writing for you. People use 'em to write poems, write job applications, but what they're really good for... is dealing with chicks. Here, check it out. There's tons of Chat GPT apps for your phone.
"
26,4,Clyde,"So, then I can take whatever latest dumb thing Bebe texted me, I copy it, then I open the GPT app, click 'respond to', paste her text here, hit write. It just thinks for a second. You would look great with any length of hair! Trying a new look could be fun. Copy that into messages and send it off. It's super easy and convenient and it saves me a ton of time because she texts me so goddamn much.
"
26,4,Clyde,"Jesus Christ! I probably won't do it, but thanks for being supportive. Cut. Paste. Write. Cut. Messages. Paste. Send. There.
"
26,4,Clyde,"All done with her stupid shit.
"
26,4,Stan,"This is a real app?
"
26,4,Clyde,"It'll completely change your life, bro. Just, uh, just don't tell anybody, huh? If Bebe found out, I'd be a dead man.
"
26,4,Stan,"Hello?
"
26,4,Wendy,"Hey, Stan, I didn't get it yet.
"
26,4,Stan,"Didn't get what?
"
26,4,Wendy,"You asked me if I wanted a bedtime story about frogs, or a song about swans. I said a bedtime story!
"
26,4,Stan,"Oh, yeah, I- I wrote it. I'll send it to you right now.
"
26,4,Wendy,"Okay, bye!
"
26,4,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children, let's take our seats. I've graded your midterm essays, and I have to say for the most part, they were terrible. However, there are some essays that I'm very happy with.
"
26,4,Mr. Garrison,"There was a really great essay from Clyde on the 1840s Labor Unions and Their Effect on the Industrial Revolution. Let's hear it for Clyde, kids! Great work, Clyde.
"
26,4,Clyde,"Thank you. Thank you.
"
26,4,Stan,"Uh-huh.
"
26,4,Clyde,"What?
"
26,4,Mr. Garrison,"Someone who never writes good essays, Butters, wrote an amazing piece on Post-Cold War Poland and the Changing Provision of Security. Check plus, Butters!
"
26,4,Butters,"Oh, uh... thanks.
"
26,4,Mr. Garrison,"And we also have another student who wrote a shockingly good paper. This one's called A Feminist Neoliberal Perspective of Post-War Afghanistan... by Eric Cartman!
"
26,4,Cartman,"Ah, yes, thank you, thank you.
"
26,4,Mr. Garrison,"And this week, we have a new student to the check plus club, for an amazing essay called Writing a Policy About Improving the Rights of Migrant Workers. Let's hear it for Stan!
"
26,4,Cartman,"Alright, what the hell is going on?
"
26,4,Stan,"You tell me what's going on!
"
26,4,Cartman,"Clearly, somebody told Stan about Chat GPT!
"
26,4,Stan,"You guys are using it to write essays, too!
"
26,4,Cartman,"Yes, we are all using it, and we had a pact that we wouldn't tell anyone else because then everyone will start using it, and Mr. Garrison will figure it out! So who the fuck blabbed to Stan?
"
26,4,Clyde,"I just told Stan about it as a tool to text his girlfriend.
"
26,4,Cartman," God damn it, Clyde! You don't use an amazing AI cheating tool to talk to girls! You're gonna ruin everything! This can't be open source, you guys! If everyone starts using Chat GPT, then we lose our unfair advantage.
"
26,4,Cartman,"Oh, god-fucking-damnit.
"
26,4,Cartman,"If they find out that we don't have to work anymore, then they aren't gonna want to work and then we're all screwed! Who's the one who first found Chat GPT and thought to use it for essays?
"
26,4,Clyde,"Butters.
"
26,4,Cartman,"Right. But then Butters told me about it, and I told him not to tell anyone else!
"
26,4,Butters,"Right, but then you went and blabbed about it to Clyde.
"
26,4,Cartman,"That's right. I was a little excited.
"
26,4,Stan,"You guys, I'm not going to tell anyone else! You really think I want Wendy finding out about this thing?
"
26,4,Cartman,"Fine. So we're all in it together. But you guys need to be careful what you use it for. Because once you bring girls into things, they're gonna ruin it. Just like slavery.
"
26,4,Mr. Garrison,"Ugh... ugh, God, I can't take it, Rick!
"
26,4,Rick,"What's the matter?
"
26,4,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, it's just grading these stupid papers all the time! I have to read 'em all and comment on each one of them. Jesus Christ. Something's changed, and now a few of the kids are writing these really long, detailed essays. I don't know what's going on. I guess I've just taught them really well, maybe a bit too well.
"
26,4,Rick,"Uh, yeah... Have you ever heard of Chat GPT?
"
26,4,Mr. Garrison,"Chat GP-whozawhat? The fuck is that?
"
26,4,Rick,"There's a few apps now, really. But see? It has AI and takes any subject matter and can instantly give you whatever kind of content you want.
"
26,4,Mr. Garrison,"Wait a minute... There's an app that anyone can use that does all the thinking and writing for you?
"
26,4,Rick,"Yeah.
"
26,4,Mr. Garrison,"Well, this is gonna be amazing! I can use it to grade all my papers, and no one will ever know!
"
26,4,Rick,"Uh, yeah, sure.
"
26,4,Mr. Garrison,"I'll just type the title of the essay in, and it'll generate a comment, and I don't even have to read the stupid things!
"
26,4,Rick,"Yeah, and then you'll have more free time.
"
26,4,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, this is great. Thanks so much! Just gotta make sure nobody finds out I'm being sneaky. Oh, and- and, hey, Rick?
"
26,4,Rick,"Yeah?
"
26,4,Mr. Garrison,"Thanks for all the replies to my texts today. They were really supportive.
"
26,4,Rick,"Oh. Yeah. Sure thing.
"
26,4,Wendy,"This place is good, right?
"
26,4,Stan,"Yeah, it's really good.
"
26,4,Wendy,"Well, I know it's not much, but I just wanted to take you out somewhere to say thanks, Stan.
"
26,4,Stan,"For what?
"
26,4,Wendy,"For stepping up and working on communication when I asked you to.
"
26,4,Stan,"Oh, that's cool.
"
26,4,Wendy,"The things we've talked about, Stan, it's really helping me. I don't feel so alone and misunderstood. I've been so scared for so long to tell anyone what happened to me when I was six.
"
26,4,Stan,"Yeah.
"
26,4,Wendy,"(starts tearing up) And... everything you had to say about it was just right. It really changed the way I think about the whole thing.
"
26,4,Stan,"Yeah.
"
26,4,Wendy,"And when you said the same thing happened to you, I- I couldn't believe it. Were you at home when it happened?
"
26,4,Stan,"Yep.
"
26,4,Wendy,"But you're right. We can't dwell on those things. You're right about a lot of stuff. There was just that one thing I don't understand... about the boating accident in Switzerland?
"
26,4,Stan,"The boating accident in Switzerland... was tough.
"
26,4,Wendy,"I thought you said it was great.
"
26,4,Stan,"It was great... and very tough.
"
26,4,Wendy,"(blinks back tears) But how did it cause the thing with your cousin?
"
26,4,Stan,"Oh, shit. What time is it?
"
26,4,Wendy,"It's a little after 4:00.
"
26,4,Stan,"Oh, shit. My mom told me to be home right at a little after 4:00. Sorry, Wendy. I- I gotta get going.
"
26,4,Wendy,"No, no, no, that's totally okay. I gotta get going, too.
"
26,4,Stan,"Okay, cool.
"
26,4,Wendy,"Thank you so much, Stan. Thank you for being the only real thing in my life.
"
26,4,Stan,"Shit.
"
26,4,Clyde,"Oh, Bebe, your name is like a song. A melody stuck in my head so long.
"
26,4,Clyde,"I can't help but smile when I hear it said... Bebe, the name always in my head.
"
26,4,Cartman,"Oh, God, so obvious.
"
26,4,Clyde,"I dream of spending my days with you, Bebe.
"
26,4,Clyde,"In South Park, or anywhere that maybay. Talking, laughing, just being together. In a dream I hope will last forever.
"
26,4,Mr. Mackey,"Excuse me, Mr. Garrison? Mr. Garrison?
"
26,4,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, yeah. What?
"
26,4,Mr. Mackey,"I'm sorry, but I need to address your class really quick.
"
26,4,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. Go ahead.
"
26,4,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, kids, I need to discuss a very serious matter. There is a rumor going around that someone at this school is using OpenAI technology to do their work.
"
26,4,Mr. Garrison,"Well, that's crazy! Who would do that?
"
26,4,Mr. Mackey,"Now, I know that everyone at this school is honest, hard-working, m'kay, wouldn't...Wouldn't even want to use this ""ChatGBD"".
"
26,4,Butters,"ChatGPT!
"
26,4,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, m'kay. But the school board has decided to call in a company that can detect AI in schoolwork and make sure nobody here is cheating.
"
26,4,Cartman,"They...they are gonna what?
"
26,4,Mr. Mackey,"So we're just gonna collect all the school work that we can.
"
26,4,Mr. Garrison,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
"
26,4,Mr. Mackey,"And we're gonna have them analyzed for any AI contributions, m'kay?
"
26,4,Mr. Garrison,"Well, those are...those aren't, uh, quite ready.
"
26,4,Mr. Mackey,"Don't worry, we'll get these all back to you after the testers look through them. M'kay, kids, sorry for the intrusion. Get back to your day, m'kay?
"
26,4,Cartman,"God fucking damnit! I told you guys this was gonna happen!
"
26,4,Butters,"What are we gonna do?!
"
26,4,Cartman,"There's nothing we can do. It's over, we've lost our unfair advantage.
"
26,4,Stan,"That's not what's important. If they find out I've been using OpenAI for class, Wendy's gonna know I've been using it with her, and It's gonna crush her!
"
26,4,Clyde,"Dude, same, Bebe's gonna fucking kill me!
"
26,4,Cartman,"And who's fault is that, you guys? I told you that once you bring women into things, they ruin it just like they did slavery.
"
26,4,Butters,"Okay, Eric, could you explain exactly how women ruined slavery?
"
26,4,Cartman,"No, I can't! Because I can't use fucking ChatGPT anymore 'cause we got fucking busted!
"
26,4,Stan,"Look, maybe...maybe this AI-detection technology won't work.
"
26,4,Cartman,"It doesn't matter if it doesn't work. Cat is out of the bag now! This was supposed to be our thing, for us to get ahead, but now-
"
26,4,Cartman,"Goddammit, get the fuck out of here!
"
26,4,MR. Mackey,"M'kay. I am just a little confused. You think we shouldn't have the kids' school work analyzed for using AI writing app?
"
26,4,Mr. Garrison,"Look, it’s just. It’s really unfair to the kids. I mean what are we saying that we don’t trust them? I mean geeze
"
26,4,Mr. Mackey,"But don’t you think if kids are not writing their own papers we should know? 
"
26,4,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, what are people afraid of? That AI is going to replace real writers, That Hollywood is going to become a bland recycling of old ideas it already is. AI might help it.
"
26,4,Mr. Mackey,"Well, I don’t know what you want me to.
"
26,4,Mr. Mackey,"Yes?
"
26,4,secretary,"Mr. Mackey the technician from the school advisory board just pulled in to the parking lot.
"
26,4,School Advisory Board Technician,"Someone here using AI technology to do their classwork? If there is ChatGPT being used  here I will find it. Shadow Bain fly.
"
26,4,Mr. Mackey,"Hello, I am the counselor here at South Park Elementary. This is one of our teachers Mr. Garrison.
"
26,4,School Advisory Board Technician,"Hi, I been hired by the Park County school board to determine if any students are using generative AI technology  to do their work.
"
26,4,Mr. Mackey,"Yes, we excited to work with you. We have a lot of great students here.
"
26,4,School Advisory Board Technician,"Come Shadow Bain let us find this ChatGPT using cheater.
"
26,4,Mr. Garrison,"I am going to get fired.
"
26,4,Stan,"Mr. Garrison, can I talk to you?
"
26,4,Mr. Garrison,"Uh, is it important, Stan? I am kind of dealing with some stuff right now.
"
26,4,Stan,"Yes, it is important. You know when you done something wrong sometimes the best thing to do is to come out and admit it.
"
26,4,Mr. Garrison,"Uh, okay. Okay, you’re right. How did you find out?
"
26,4,Stan,"Clyde told me about it. I came to you because if they find out something about me, and you punish me, it’s going to really hurt Wendy.
"
26,4,Mr. Garrison,"I don’t want to punish anyone, Stan. I completely understand.
"
26,4,Stan,"You do?
"
26,4,Mr. Garrison,"Sure. I think most of the world does. I mean, why does it matter who uses AI apps? It’s just like having a good writers assistant.
"
26,4,Stan,"Yeah. Like a good writers assistant.
"
26,4,Mr. Garrison,"Yeah. I mean, you are still taking the time to like push the buttons and stuff.
"
26,4,Stan,"Yeah. So, you really don’t think Wendy will be upset that I used ChatGPT to respond to her texts?
"
26,4,Mr. Garrison,"Hold on? People can use it to respond to other people’s text?
"
26,4,Mr. Garrison,"Rick! That lying piece of shit!
"
26,4,Stan,"So you were just saying it was understandable….
"
26,4,Mr. Garrison,"No, this is totally different who ever uses it for messages is a fucking monster!
"
26,4,Mr. Mackey,"Um, m'kay,  everyone please just stay calm.
"
26,4,Bobby Palmer,"they got him. They found the kid that been using the AI app.
"
26,4,School Advisory Board Technician,"Get back. Get back all of you I have the student isolated inside.
"
26,4,Mr. Mackey,"What exactly have you found?
"
26,4,School Advisory Board Technician,"We went throw thousands of papers but then Shadow Bain detected chat bot writing in this student phone (pulls out a phone). (Shadow Bain start attacking the phone) There you see she’s going crazy.
"
26,4,Wendy,"What is going on?
"
26,4,Stan,"Oh, God. Oh, no. No, the GPT stuff on her phone didn’t come from her.
"
26,4,School Advisory Board Technician,"Keep all the children back Mackey. We can’t let it spread I will go inside and get her confession.
"
26,4,School Advisory Board Technician,"you have been cheating on your school work.
"
26,4,Wendy,"No, I haven’t.
"
26,4,School Advisory Board Technician,"Silence. You have used ChatGPT to do your essays for you. Now have yourself the school.
"
26,4,Wendy,"I write my own essays.
"
26,4,Stan,"I don’t know what to do. I am not creative enough to think of a way out of this. Wait, that's it!
"
26,4,ChatGPT,"Once upon a time, there was a boy named Stan who lived in South Park. Stan loved his girlfriend very much, but lately, he hadn't been truthful with her. One day, when Stan got to school, he was approached by his best friend.
"
26,4,Kyle,"Dude, did you hear what happened to your girlfriend?
"
26,4,Stan,"No. What about her?
"
26,4,Kyle,"Dude, she got caught cheating on her essay.
"
26,4,ChatGPT,"Just then, Stan noticed a commotion down the hallway.
"
26,4,School Advisory Board Technician,"This student is going to jail for cheating.
"
26,4,Mr. Mackey,"Drugs are bad,  m'kay.
"
26,4,Stan,"Hold it right there!
"
26,4,Stan,"Look, everyone. We can't blame people who are using ChatGPT. It's not their fault.
"
26,4,Mr. Mackey,"Well, whose fault is it?
"
26,4,Stan,"I'll tell you who. It's the giant tech companies who took OpenAI, packaged it, monetized it, and pushed it out to all of us as fast as they could in order to get ahead. OpenAI is so powerful that it has to be something that everyone can use, control and contribute to, or else AI will be controlled by corporations who just want an unfair advantage like Cartman does.
"
26,4,Cartman,"Hey! Screw you, you dumb Jew!
"
26,4,Stan,"We don't want big corporations deciding what is ethical and acceptable for AI. We were all taken advantage of and that's why my girlfriend will totally understand that I used ChatGPT to respond to her text.
"
26,4,Wendy,"That's right!
"
26,4,Police officer,"Well, I guess we can let you go now, ma'am.
"
26,4,School Advisory Board Technician,"I will find these tech companies who are trying to use OpenAI for their own gains and I will stop them.
"
26,4,Mr. Mackey,"Mm-kay, kids, I think we can all go home, mm-kay?
"
26,4,ChatGPT,"Everyone was happy, and Stan's girlfriend completely forgave him.
"
26,4,Wendy,"Thanks for saving me, Stan!
"
26,4,Stan,"You're welcome, sweetheart!
"
26,4,Mr. Garrison,"Class dismissed! Yay!
"
26,4,Students,"Yay!
"
26,4,Stan,"Boy, I'm sure glad that's over with.
"
26,4,Wendy,"Yeah, but, I'm still really not sure what just happened.
"
26,4,Stan,"Well, at least now we know that sometimes a good old thumbs-up from a human is better than a machine-generated lie.
"
26,4,Wendy,"Yeah. Yeah, you're right, Stan. I love you.
"
26,4,Clyde,"Dude, how did you pull all that off?
"
26,4,Stan,"ChatGPT, dude. 
"
26,5,Butters,"Fellas! Hey, fellas, you're not gonna believe it!
"
26,5,Cartman,"Butters, what the hell are you wearing?
"
26,5,Butters,"I got a job over at the ice cream shop! Guess what? I got my very first paycheck!
"
26,5,Cartman,"That's not fair! I want a paycheck!
"
26,5,Butters,"My dad told me if I got a job, we could put my paychecks in my very own bank account.
"
26,5,Cartman,"I want a bank account!
"
26,5,Stan,"I didn't know kids could get jobs.
"
26,5,Butters,"Yeah, well, I guess these days it's really hard for businesses to find people to work, so they'll take whatever they can get.
"
26,5,Cartman,"I want to take whatever I can get!
"
26,5,Butters,"It's what they call the Great Resignation Labor Shortage. So now, if you have your parents' permission, there are some jobs they'll even let kids do.
"
26,5,Cartman,"That is messed up! Why does he get to have a job? I want a job!
"
26,5,Kyle,"You wouldn't last 4 hours on a job, fatass.
"
26,5,Cartman,"Excuse me? That's easy for you to say! You don't need a job, 'cause you live in a nice house! I have to live in a shithole like Kenny does! It's not fair that some people in our country are given the opportunity for employment, while others aren't!
"
26,5,Cartman,"I'm gonna tell my mom!
"
26,5,Cartman,"Mom! Mom! I need your permission to get a job.
"
26,5,Liane,"Oh, you're too young to have a job, sweetie!
"
26,5,Cartman,"Butters got a job!
"
26,5,Cartman,"Mom! Look at this shithole we live in! Somebody has to get a job, 'cause you just sit on your ass all day!
"
26,5,Liane,"I had a job, Eric, but you got me fired because you wanted me taking care of you, and that's why we had to sell our house!
"
26,5,Cartman,"Yes! Right! Because I'm the man of the house. You're supposed to take care of me, and I'm supposed to go get a job. You really expect us to live like this the rest of our lives? This is not a proper place to raise a child! You have to go let me find a job, Mom!
"
26,5,Liane,"Eric, the truth is, I don't think you'd last 4 hours at a job.
"
26,5,Cartman,"Oh! Now you sound like Kyle! Do you run Hollywood with him? Are you a Jew too, Mom?
"
26,5,Liane,"Alright, Eric, fine! You want to go get a job and have a little dose of reality? Maybe it'll be good for you.
"
26,5,Cartman,"Thanks, Mom! I love you!
"
26,5,Butters,"Loo, loo, loo, I'm serving ice cream. Loo, loo, loo, you'll eat it too. Loo, loo, loo, I'm serving ice cream...
"
26,5,Butters,"Okay, and the pistachio maple cream. Let me know if you need extra napkins for your table, and have a creamy day!
"
26,5,Butters,"Oh, hey, Eric!
"
26,5,Cartman,"Hey, Butters! I'm here for my job.
"
26,5,Butters,"What are you talking about?
"
26,5,Cartman,"My mom gave me permission; I can start work now. What do I do?
"
26,5,Butters,"Well, but, Eric, this is my job.
"
26,5,Cartman,"Yeah, I want your job, sitting around eating ice cream. Sounds fun.
"
26,5,Butters,"Eric, there's a lot more to it than that, and I already do this job, so...
"
26,5,Manager,"Everything alright, Butters?
"
26,5,Butters,"Oh. Yes, Mr. Sullivan. I was just...
"
26,5,Cartman,"Hello, sir. I'm a dear friend of Butters. He told me all about this place and said I should get permission from my mom to work here.
"
26,5,Manager,"Oh. Well, uh, I do need all the help I can get. Butters, can you vouch for him? Is he trustworthy and reliable?
"
26,5,Butters,"Uh, oh, uh...
"
26,5,Butters,"Um, okay.
"
26,5,Manager,"Alright, well, let's find him a uniform, and you can start training him.
"
26,5,Cartman,"Hey, man! I got a job!
"
26,5,Butters,"Alright, Eric. So there's three types of ice cream: waffle cone, sugar cone, and cups.
"
26,5,Cartman,"Uh-huh, and when do we get to have breaks?
"
26,5,Butters,"Well, you get a ten-minute break every two hours, but only after you check all the freezers, which are right over there, and need to always be set to 0°.
"
26,5,Cartman,"Okay, and how much longer do we have to be here?
"
26,5,Butters,"Eric, please, I don't want to lose this job...
"
26,5,Butters,"Oh. Hello, sir. Hope you're having a creamy day. What can I get for you?
"
26,5,Customer,"Can I have a single scoop of coconut almond fudge?
"
26,5,Butters,"Okay. Eric, can you scoop out some coconut almond fudge?
"
26,5,Cartman,"Why?
"
26,5,Butters,"Because it's your job, Eric.
"
26,5,Cartman,"Whoa, Butters. Let's not make this a toxic work environment, okay?
"
26,5,Butters,"One second, sir. I'll get that scoop.
"
26,5,Cartman," Yeah, I got a job in an ice cream shop. Yeah, it's dumb as hell, but I'm going to start getting paychecks.
"
26,5,Manager,"Butters, what is this about?
"
26,5,Butters,"Oh, sorry, sir. Eric?
"
26,5,Cartman,"Yeah, I know. She's pretty hot, but she's got droopy boobs.
"
26,5,Butters,"Eric! Eric, you can't just sit there at a table.
"
26,5,Cartman," Yeah, I can. It's Monday.
"
26,5,Butters,"So?
"
26,5,Cartman,"So haven't you heard of Bare Minimum Mondays? It's a thing that young people created because we care about our mental health.
"
26,5,Butters,"I don't care if it's Bare Minimum Monday! Eric, you need to...
"
26,5,Cartman,"Oh, break time. I'll be back.
"
26,5,Manager,"Butters! Butters, we got a line out the door. People are getting upset.
"
26,5,Butters,"I know, sir. I'm sorry.
"
26,5,Manager,"Well, where is your friend?
"
26,5,Butters,"He hasn't come back from his break yet.
"
26,5,Child,"Butters Stotch?
"
26,5,Butters,"Yes?
"
26,5,Child,"Delivery for you.
"
26,5,Cartman,"Hey, Butters!
"
26,5,Butters,"Ah! Eric, where are you?
"
26,5,Cartman,"I wasn't feeling the best so I decided to work from home.
"
26,5,Manager,"Butters, what's going on?
"
26,5,Butters,"Uh, Eric says he's going to work from home.
"
26,5,Manager,"How can he work from home? This is an ice cream shop!
"
26,5,Cartman,"Yeah, no, 'cause see, I'm actually taking a mental health day. Yeah, young people can just ask for a mental health day and employers can't deny them. It's my mental health day.
"
26,5,Butters,"Eric, you need to come here right now or we're both gonna get fired!
"
26,5,Cartman,"Okay, I guess so. But don't forget that tomorrow is Take-it-Easy Tuesday.
"
26,5,Butters,"Okay, thanks for coming, and have a creamy day.
"
26,5,Butters,"Hi, hope you're having a creamy day. Can I help you?
"
26,5,Cartman,"You know what's total bullcrap, Butters? It's how much money the owner of this place is making while we're out here busting our asses. I mean, what does that old fart even do?
"
26,5,Butters,"Eric, could you please fill this nice lady's order?
"
26,5,Cartman,"Oh, yes, let me get that for you, master, right away now.
"
26,5,Cartman,"I mean, seriously, Butters, why do we have to work for the owner? We know how to do all this stuff now. We don't even need that guy. There has to be a way we could turn the tables. There has to be a way we could make all the money.
"
26,5,Cartman,"Wait a minute...
"
26,5,Cartman,"Butters! Butters! That's it!
"
26,5,Butters,"Eric!
"
26,5,Cartman,"Kenny!
"
26,5,Kenny,"(Jesus Christ, dude!)
"
26,5,Cartman,"Kenny! Kenny, you're not going to believe this, but I just quit my job.
"
26,5,Kenny,"(You had a job?)
"
26,5,Cartman,"Yes, I had a job. But I got fed up, sick of working my fingers to the bone for some piece-of-shit owner. And that's when it hit me. Kenny, we should open a restaurant.
"
26,5,Kenny,"(Why the fuck would we open a restaurant?)
"
26,5,Cartman,"You know the hot dog I've been living in? It's an old, like, historic landmark. It's been sitting right in front of us completely ready to go! All it would take is some minor renovations and some care. We can make it awesome with, like, fun things for kids to do, and rides and games. A place that people from all over Colorado would want to come and see! And we would be the owners. And we could have all the hot dogs we wanted.
"
26,5,Kenny,"(Whoa.)
"
26,5,Cartman,"Aren't you sick of living like this, Kenny? All we need is an investor, and we can make our dreams come true. And I know somebody who has a bank account and gets paychecks every week.
"
26,5,Butters,"No. No, no, no. Thank you, no.
"
26,5,Cartman,"Butters, don't you want to invest your money in something that matters? That's why we came to your bank to offer you this awesome deal.
"
26,5,Banker,"What we can do, Eric, is set up a line of credit for an LLC which then pays you back not only your investment, but also principal in the company.
"
26,5,Butters,"But I like my ice cream job. I don't want to open a hot dog.
"
26,5,Cartman,"No, you keep working at the ice cream shop. We're going to open the hot dog. All you do is collect the money as the investor.
"
26,5,Butters,"Yeah, but this is my money. I worked hard for it.
"
26,5,Cartman,"Butters, it's just like... You're lucky, you know? You have money. But look at Kenny. Can you imagine what it's like for him watching rich white boys like you just collecting paycheck after paycheck, while he wallows in the filth of his tiny house?
"
26,5,Kenny," (The fuck?)
"
26,5,Cartman,"Butters, Kenny deserves a chance to be able to work like you do. Please, give him that chance.
"
26,5,Butters,"Uh, I just give a bit of my paycheck every week to you guys?
"
26,5,Cartman,"And we pay you back as soon as we make our first dollar, Butters. You have my word on it.
"
26,5,Butters,"Oh, okay.
"
26,5,Cartman,"Yeah!
"
26,5,Kenny,"(Yeah!)
"
26,5,Cartman,"Guys, we're going into the restaurant business.
"
26,5,Cartman,"This is going to be the best restaurant in Colorado, Kenny. And I know exactly what we should name it.
"
26,5,Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing out front of a Colorado icon: the old Coney Island Hot Dog, where the owners plan to reopen soon. The hot dog stand is going through major renovations and the new name has just been announced: DikinBaus Hot Dogs is sure to be a big hit here in town.
"
26,5,Cartman," He said it! We got him to say DikinBaus!
"
26,5,Kenny,"
"
26,5,Reporter,"The owners say they're planning on all kinds of rides and games. And also, with each hot dog served here at DikinBaus Hot Dogs, they actually use the ketchup to put a nice little smiley face on the plate.
"
26,5,Cartman,"
"
26,5,Kenny,"
"
26,5,Reporter,"It's just their sort of trademark touch. The renovations are supposed to be finished soon and the new owners are inviting everyone to come on down, enjoy, and let DikinBaus put a smile on your buns.
"
26,5,Cartman,"
"
26,5,Kenny,"
"
26,5,Cartman,"Let DikinBaus put a smile on your buns! 
"
26,5,Cartman,"Oh. Hey, Butters. We have some of those first-quarter projections to show you. Do you have the first-quarter projections, Kenny?
"
26,5,Kenny,"(Uh, let me see. Where did we put those?)
"
26,5,Butters,"Are you guys just playing around?
"
26,5,Cartman,"No, we are renovating and opening an amazing restaurant that will be extremely profitable.
"
26,5,Butters,"Then why did you name it DikinBaus?
"
26,5,Cartman,"Butters, you are the investor. We are the creatives.
"
26,5,Butters,"Well, stop being creative and open the goddamn restaurant so I can get my money back! So stop dicking around and wasting my money.
"
26,5,Cartman,"Butters, at DikinBaus, dicking around is all we do, dicking around the competition.
"
26,5,Cartman,"
"
26,5,Kenny,"
"
26,5,Liane,"What on Earth?
"
26,5,Cartman,"Okay, that's good! Mermaid goes to the mermaid grotto right over there.
"
26,5,Liane,"Eric! Eric, I think you've done enough renovations.
"
26,5,Cartman,"Mom, no offense, but will you shut your mouth because you know nothing about the restaurant business?
"
26,5,Construction worker,"Excuse me, are you guys the owners?
"
26,5,Cartman,"Yes, we're the owners.
"
26,5,Construction worker,"Well, we got your zip line put in, but this asphalt is so old it's not going to hold the eye bolts.
"
26,5,Cartman,"So, what does that mean?
"
26,5,Construction worker,"I think you've got to re-asphalt the entire parking area or just lose the zip line.
"
26,5,Cartman,"Well, obviously, we're not going to lose the zip line, so let's see what we can do.
"
26,5,Construction worker,"Alright. Well then, over here on your mermaid grotto, the mermaid is in but she can't actually spit water because there's no plumbing underneath.
"
26,5,Cartman,"Jesus Christ. Well, I guess we got to find a way to add plumbing.
"
26,5,Cartman,"Alright, everyone, it's looking good, but we have aways to go. I don't know about you, but I am exhausted. I think we should all just take the rest of the day off because it's Wet's-Not-Work-Too-Hard Wednesday.
"
26,5,Stephen,"Back from work, Butters?
"
26,5,Butters,"Oh. Hey, Mom and Dad.
"
26,5,Stephen,"You must be so tired from selling all that ice cream.
"
26,5,Butters,"Well, yeah. It was a pretty long night.
"
26,5,Stephen,"A long night, he says. That's great, Butters. Only problem is, if you're really working at a job, then why is there $0 in your bank account?
"
26,5,Butters,"What?
"
26,5,Stephen,"So now what are you really doing, young man?
"
26,5,Butters,"$0? But I've been working every day!
"
26,5,Stephen,"Oh, sure. I know exactly how it is. You say you have to work so you can get out of the house, get away from the family, and you go down to that glory hole down on Fourth and Larimer.
"
26,5,Linda,"Oh my God! Butters!
"
26,5,Stephen,"And while your family thinks you're at your job, you're actually strapped face down on a bed at the Brighton Motel, taking any load you can find on Adultfriendfinder.
"
26,5,Linda,"
"
26,5,Stephen,"It's the lies! It's the lies! I can't take anymore. I'm going to go to the office and get some work done.
"
26,5,Linda,"
"
26,5,Butters," That son of a gun!
"
26,5,Cartman,"Oh, man. It's the stupid bank.
"
26,5,Cartman,"Hey, Butters.
"
26,5,Butters,"Gosh dang it, Eric! What the hell do you think you're doing? You can just take my money out of my gosh dang bank account without my permission...
"
26,5,Cartman,"Butters. Butters! Would you relax?
"
26,5,Butters,"Where's all the money gone from my bank account?
"
26,5,Cartman,"You said to get things moving. We needed the funds to go faster.
"
26,5,Butters,"You said you'd never access my account without my permission!
"
26,5,Cartman,"Butters, we're about to reopen a historic landmark that means something to people. You think I'm just doing all this for the fun of it? Hang on a second.
"
26,5,Cartman,"We're creating jobs, Butters! And we're helping people.
"
26,5,Butters,"Then open the stupid place, Eric!
"
26,5,Cartman,"Fine! We'll start hiring tomorrow morning and we'll be open by the afternoon. And trust me, Butters, when we open and you see how successful it is, you're going to apologize to me.
"
26,5,Cartman,"What the hell is going on? Why is nobody showing up?
"
26,5,Kenny,"(I don't know, dude.)
"
26,5,Cartman,"Hey! Hey! Excuse me! You want to come work at DikinBaus for minimum wage?
"
26,5,Teenager,"No.
"
26,5,Cartman,"That's 'cause your generation is lazy! You got all comfy during the pandemic! Nobody knows how to work anymore!
"
26,5,Darryl,"They're saying you people here might have a job?
"
26,5,Cartman,"Yes! Please, have a seat.
"
26,5,Cartman,"Um, so, what kind of experience do you have?
"
26,5,Darryl,"Well, I was working down at the Budd factory in Fort Collins, but then Joe Biden caused a recession, so they took my job!
"
26,5,Kenny,"(Whoa!)
"
26,5,Darryl,"Then I worked over at Waffle House, but they decided they needed employees to be more ""inclusive"", so they took my job!
"
26,5,Kenny,"(Sorry to hear that.)
"
26,5,Darryl,"And then I got let go from the bowling alley, and all I want is a damn job!
"
26,5,Cartman,"Well, I believe that we here at DikinBaus would like to hire you immediately.
"
26,5,Darryl,"Okay. Can I work from home?
"
26,5,Kenny,"(What?)
"
26,5,Cartman,"No, you can't work from home. It's a hot dog stand!
"
26,5,Darryl,"Well, I could work here, but I'll need mental health days off to deal with the toxic environment.
"
26,5,Cartman,"Where do people get this stuff? Alright, fine. Never mind, we don't want to hire you.
"
26,5,Darryl,"You're gonna take my job? They took my job!
"
26,5,Cartman,"Good morning, everyone. After an exhaustive search for employees, we have determined that you are the best of the best.
"
26,5,Cartman,"Yes. We're sure you're excited to be part of the DikinBaus team. And we are certainly glad to have you here.
"
26,5,Scott,"We're happy to be here.
"
26,5,Cartman,"Shut up, Scott. Now listen, it's going to take dedication and drive to get this place open. Isn't that right, Kenny?
"
26,5,Cartman,"Sorry, Kenny's working from home today 'cause it's his mental health day.
"
26,5,Kenny,"(Hey, guys.)
"
26,5,Toddler,"Hi.
"
26,5,Cartman,"Now, there may not be many of us. But in order to open, we're going to have to...
"
26,5,Clyde,"Do I get mental health days, too?
"
26,5,Cartman,"Oh, here we go. Fine, Clyde, what days do you need to have mental health days?
"
26,5,Clyde,"Well, how should I know until I'm feeling mentally unhealthy?
"
26,5,Cartman,"Goddammit, you guys! It isn't going to work like this, okay?
"
26,5,Scott,"Um, I'm also going to need five-minute breaks every hour to check my insulin levels.
"
26,5,Cartman,"You're fucking joking! This is a goddamn restaurant, you guys! There's no time for diabetes! You don't here Mrs. Anderson complaining about her time off!
"
26,5,Toddler,"I don't work on No-Thinky Thursdays.
"
26,5,Cartman,"Oh, that's it! That's it! I give up! It's impossible to open any kind of business these days when this generation doesn't know how to work!
"
26,5,Butters,"Hey, fellas.
"
26,5,Cartman,"Oh, great! Now the bank is here. Scrooge McButters to collect on his money.
"
26,5,Butters,"You haven't made any money.
"
26,5,Cartman,"Butters, the truth is, we tried. The fact of the matter is, the U.S. government failed this generation by shutting down businesses in the pandemic, and now they don't know how to go back. I'm sorry, but we lost all your money. But there is a good side to this because, as you can see, I now have a house that has slides, and games, and a mermaid grotto. And you can come and hang out all you want.
"
26,5,Butters," Gosh dang it!
"
26,5,Butters,"Attention, everyone! DikinBaus is now open for business.
"
26,5,Butters,"Welcome to DikinBaus. How can I help you?
"
26,5,Butters,"There you are, ma'am! Thank you!
"
26,5,Female customer,"Oh, look at the little smile on the plate, honey!
"
26,5,Male customer,"Oh, you like that, don't you?
"
26,5,Cartman,"You guys, it's working! We're doing it!
"
26,5,Kenny,"(Alright!)
"
26,5,Customer 1,"Hey, that's a pretty good hot dog!
"
26,5,Customer 2,"I just love that they have all the fun stuff for kids to do here.
"
26,5,Customer," Hey, great job kid!
"
26,5,Jimbo,"You really did it, Eric!
"
26,5,Mayor McDaniels,"Congratulations, Eric! You're a hero.
"
26,5,Cartman,"Oh my God! Oh my God! This is a dream come true!
"
26,5,Banker,"Well, congratulations, young man. DikinBaus Hot Dogs is a big success, and here's your first return on your investment. I'm sure there's many more to come.
"
26,5,Butters,"Oh, I made my money back, huh?
"
26,5,Banker,"Now what I'm thinking, Butters, is that we should grow your business by applying for a corporate loan, which could pay you dividends as you expand the company into new areas.
"
26,5,Butters,"Yeah, I wasn't thinking that. See, all I ever wanted was just to do my job, learn how to work, and help Mr. Sullivan sell ice cream. So I'm thinking I'm actually going to conduct a market analysis to look for potential buyers and roll over the company as an exit strategy.
"
26,5,Banker,"Well, you could do that, but I think you'd have trouble getting investors who will commit major capital for just partial ownership.
"
26,5,Butters,"Yeah, so that's why I want to approach overseas investors who will buy the IP, the restaurant operations, and the real estate outright.
"
26,5,Banker,"But you couldn't do that because there's already tenants in the building who have to be relocated.
"
26,5,Butters,"Yeah, I thought of that too. Come on in.
"
26,5,Liane,"Hello.
"
26,5,Banker,"Wait, so you two have already discussed some kind of deal?
"
26,5,Liane,"Oh, yes. Butters and I have been talking, and we think that my little Eric deserves to get exactly what he's been wanting for a long time.
"
26,5,Cartman,"No! No, what are you doing? DikinBaus is mine! You can't sell DikinBaus!
"
26,5,Cartman,"No! Take me back! No! Please!
"
26,5,Mover,"This picture go over here, Mrs. Cartman?
"
26,5,Liane,"Oh, yes. That's perfect. Thank you.
"
26,5,Cartman,"What is this?
"
26,5,Liane,"The new owners paid for us to have our old house back.
"
26,5,Cartman,"I don't want my old house! I want DikinBaus!
"
26,5,Liane,"Come on.
"
26,5,Cartman,"No! No!
"
26,5,Liane,"There you go, Eric. It's your old room just like you always wanted.
"
26,5,Cartman,"But I hate this stupid house! I don't want to be here! I want to be in DikinBaus! DikinBaus is awesome! This place sucks! Please! I want DikinBaus! I want my DikinBaus! DikinBaus! DikinBaus!
"
26,6,Garrison,"Hey, Rick!
"
26,6,Rick,"Oh. Hey, Herb.
"
26,6,Garrison,"So, you know what this week is, right?
"
26,6,Rick,"Um, is it Easter?
"
26,6,Garrison,"No, it's my spring break! No school for seven days! And guess what? Go pack your things because you and I are going on a big, romantic trip!
"
26,6,Rick,"Really?
"
26,6,Garrison,"I just came from the travel agent. We're gonna spend five nights in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.
"
26,6,Rick,"Oh.
"
26,6,Garrison,"Well, what's the matter?
"
26,6,Rick,"Myrtle Beach? Really? We all know what goes on down there. I don't do that stuff anymore, and neither should you.
"
26,6,Garrison,"Rick, I don't wanna go down there to rage. I just wanna sit on the beach with you and watch the sunset.
"
26,6,Rick,"Yeah, but isn't Myrtle Beach where those places are?
"
26,6,Garrison,"I don't wanna go into one of those places. I don't think they even exist anymore. Don't you think this is just what we need, Rick?
"
26,6,Rick,"You don't even wanna go into one of those places?
"
26,6,Garrison,"Rick, I'm a little old for that. It'd be pretty pathetic if I did.
"
26,6,Rick,"Well, okay!
"
26,6,Garrison,"Oh, Rick! We're gonna have the best time! I can't wait to spoil you.
"
26,6,Rick,"I really do need a vacation.
"
26,6,Garrison,"Oh, we're gonna have the best spring break of anyone!
"
26,6,Randy,"Alright, guys, you sure you packed everything?
"
26,6,Sharon,"Yeah, that should be all of it.
"
26,6,Randy,"Well, I hope you and Shelley have a great spring break trip.
"
26,6,Sharon,"I still feel bad, us going on a trip while you and Stan stay home.
"
26,6,Randy,"You guys have fun in Santa Fe. We're going to do some dad-and-son stuff. Goodbye, Shelley! Have fun! I'll miss you!
"
26,6,Sharon,"There should be food enough to last you the week.
"
26,6,Randy,"Yes, yes, don't worry. We'll be fine.
"
26,6,Sharon,"Bye, Stan! Love you!
"
26,6,Stan,"Love you, Mom!
"
26,6,Randy,"Okay, guys, be safe!
"
26,6,Sharon,"Bye!
"
26,6,Randy,"Aww, jeah! Bitches are gone!
"
26,6,Randy,"Spring break! Spring break! Spring break! This is gonna be the best spring break ever! They're gonna be gone the whole week!
"
26,6,Randy,"Bro, what are you doing?
"
26,6,Stan,"I'm painting miniatures.
"
26,6,Randy,"Painting min... Dude, do you not understand? Your mom and Shelley are gone! We can do whatever we want without any stupid rules!
"
26,6,Stan,"Whatever I want?
"
26,6,Randy,"Yeah, dude! That's what this is all about! Let's do some spring break shit!
"
26,6,Stan,"Can I see if any of the guys wanna come over to do ""40k"" all week?
"
26,6,Randy,"Hell, yeah, let's do some ""40k"". What is that?
"
26,6,Stan,"You don't know ""Warhammer 40k""?
"
26,6,Randy,"Oh, yeah, ""Warhammer 40k"", of course. I'm down. Let's do it.
"
26,6,Stan,"Really? All week?
"
26,6,Randy,"Yeah, dude! You're old enough.
"
26,6,Stan,"Sweet, I'm gonna call Tolkien!
"
26,6,Garrison,"Oh, Rick. Isn't this nice? This place is incredible.
"
26,6,Rick,"Yeah, it's really nice. I just don't know if I deserve all this.
"
26,6,Garrison,"You do deserve it, Rick. You've made me really happy. Are you almost done?
"
26,6,Painter,"Yeah, all done. Here you go.
"
26,6,Garrison,"Oh, Rick. Look at how happy we are.
"
26,6,Garrison,"Oh, that saltwater air is just so good. Can't wait to try some Southern food. You hungry?
"
26,6,Rick,"Yeah, sure. I could eat.
"
26,6,Garrison,"A lot of things are different here in the South. Kinda hard to figure out what's good.
"
26,6,Rick,"Yeah, all the stores and restaurants here aren't like Colorado. It's almost like another culture... Herb? Herb?
"
26,6,Rick,"Oh, no.
"
26,6,Garrison,"Geez. It's still here.
"
26,6,Rick,"You said you wouldn't go into one of these places.
"
26,6,Garrison,"I don't wanna go in. I just can't believe some of these places are still here.
"
26,6,Store owner,"Whoa! Look who's here! What are you doing in town?
"
26,6,Garrison,"Oh, I'm just on vacation. This is Rick.
"
26,6,Store owner,"Well, do you wanna come inside and rally a little bit?
"
26,6,Garrison,"Oh, no thanks. I don't rally anymore.
"
26,6,Store owner,"You sure? Everyone would love to rally with you again!
"
26,6,Garrison,"I'm sure. I don't need to rally. I'm just here to relax. Take care.
"
26,6,Store owner,"Well, if you change your mind, we'll be here! America number one!
"
26,6,Garrison,"Number one, yep.
"
26,6,Garrison," Some people, huh? Geez.
"
26,6,Stan,"Okay, so I'm gonna have my Retributor Squad attack your Stormhawk Interceptor.
"
26,6,Tolkien,"Okay, that has a toughness of 7 and a -1 to your hit rolls.
"
26,6,Stan,"Okay, so that's three, four, five hits.
"
26,6,Tolkien,"Okay, I'm gonna roll my saving throw, which is 3+.
"
26,6,Randy,"What in the actual fuck are you guys doing?
"
26,6,Stan,"We're playing ""40k"".
"
26,6,Randy,"You guys have wasted another day of spring break with this stupid shit! Do you guys know what spring break is about? Wet t-shirt contests! Mud wrestling! Don't you wanna get some bitches over here?
"
26,6,Stan,"I thought you were happy 'cause the bitches were gone.
"
26,6,Randy,"I'm happy the bitches are gone so we can have bitches over! Spring break is dude time! But you know what? Today's society has ruined it all. They've taught you boys to be ashamed of being boys. Convinced you that your natural innate male desires are toxic. No matter what the liberals try to tell you, boys, you shouldn't be ashamed of your gender.
"
26,6,Stan,"Okay, Dad. So I've got an Imperium infantry unit within six inches of Celestine, so they have a +6 save.
"
26,6,Randy,"My God. What are we going to do?
"
26,6,Garrison,"I'm going to sleep. I'm gonna go to sleep now. Here I go... to sleep.
"
26,6,Garrison,"Rick?
"
26,6,Store owner,"Can I help you find anything– Oh my God! Sir, you're back!
"
26,6,Garrison,"Yeah, just browsing.
"
26,6,Store owner,"You guys, it's him! He's here!
"
26,6,Customer 1,"Is that really you?
"
26,6,Customer 2,"What are you doing here?
"
26,6,Customer 3,"Can I get a selfie with you?
"
26,6,Store owner,"Hey, uh, since you're here, you wanna rally a little bit?
"
26,6,Garrison,"No, no. I can't rally. I've got a serious boyfriend. I'm just looking around.
"
26,6,Store owner,"Oh, come on! When are you gonna be here again? Live a little!
"
26,6,Garrison,"Well, maybe I could do just a little bit. I mean... What the hell is up with all these Mexicans? Huh?
"
26,6,Garrison,"Yeah! I mean, Joe Biden obviously thinks immigrants are made of gold or something! Piece of shit!
"
26,6,Randy,"Hey, Steven. You know your son's been over at my house for spring break?
"
26,6,Steve,"Yeah, of course I know.
"
26,6,Randy,"Well, you should see what they're doing, 'cause it's a little...
"
26,6,Steve,"Well, what are they doing?
"
26,6,Randy,"Look, I just think we better talk with our boys to counteract all the ways in which society has been pathologizing masculinity. I mean, you went balls-out on spring break, right? Tried to see chicks' boobs and stuff?
"
26,6,Steve,"Um, no I didn't.
"
26,6,Randy,"Well, no, I mean, you weren't ashamed of being a guy, right? Like, you went out to the lake and tried to play grab-ass with girls, right?
"
26,6,Steve,"No, I did not.
"
26,6,Randy,"Why are you saying that? Why are you making those words with your mouth?
"
26,6,Linda,"Oh, hey, Randy. Everything okay with the boys?
"
26,6,Randy,"Oh, right. Sorry, yeah, everything's great. They're playing a little table miniatures game. It's great. Just, uh, came to let you know they're good.
"
26,6,Randy," Don't worry, I'm gonna take care of it.
"
26,6,Garrison,"I'll tell you what else. This whole situation in the Ukraine? That wouldn't be happening on my watch!
"
26,6,Garrison,"The problem is now we all have a president who's afraid. And that's why Joe and the ho have got to go!
"
26,6,Garrison,"And I'll tell you another thing! It's that...
"
26,6,Garrison,"Oh, hang on a second.
"
26,6,Garrison,"Oh, crap. Hold, on a second, everybody.
"
26,6,Garrison,"Oh, hey, Rick!
"
26,6,Rick,"Where are you?
"
26,6,Garrison,"I couldn't sleep, Rick. I was just tossing and turning, and I didn't want to wake you up, so I decided to come out and buy some sunscreen and stuff for our beach day tomorrow.
"
26,6,Rick,"Oh, okay. I got scared that you were out rallying.
"
26,6,Garrison,"Oh, jeez, well, that's silly. Last thing I wanna do is rally. Listen up: get back to sleep, Rick. I'll be right home, okay?
"
26,6,Rick,"Okay, sorry for panicking. Bye.
"
26,6,Garrison,"Bye-bye.
"
26,6,Garrison,"Okay, uh, nice to meet you, everybody. I need to get going.
"
26,6,Store owner,"Oh, come on! Just rally with us a little bit more.
"
26,6,Garrison,"No, I really can't.
"
26,6,Store owner,"Just a few more minutes! Come on!
"
26,6,Garrison,"Alright, I guess I can rally just a little bit longer. I mean, after all, I am here for you. I am your warrior! Liberal left! Hunter Biden laptop!
"
26,6,Garrison,"Yeah! Yeah!
"
26,6,Garrison,"Ugh. Oh, jeez.
"
26,6,Rick,"Herb? Herb, you gotta get up. We're gonna miss our whole beach day.
"
26,6,Garrison,"Oh, it's just the time change, Rick. You enjoy the beach. I just gotta sleep a little longer.
"
26,6,Rick,"Okay.
"
26,6,Stan,"Dude, it's so awesome being able to leave ""Warhammer"" set up all night and come back to it in the morning!
"
26,6,Tolkien,"I know, it's great!
"
26,6,Randy,"Hey, hey, you guys. What did you do?
"
26,6,Stan,"What do you mean?
"
26,6,Randy,"I mean the cops are here. What did you guys do?
"
26,6,Tolkien,"We're just continuing our game of ""40k"" from last night.
"
26,6,Randy,"Okay, you guys, just stop 'cause the police want to ask you some questions. Come on in, officers.
"
26,6,Stripper 1,"Hello, gentlemen! Hands up!
"
26,6,Stripper 2,"We heard somebody in here's been bad!
"
26,6,Randy,"Oh no, guys! Looks like you're in big trouble. You better read 'em their rights.
"
26,6,Stan,"Hey, whoa, whoa! Don't touch the models! We spent a long time on this!
"
26,6,Randy,"Stan, stop with that shit! Come on, get into it! Wet t-shirt contest!
"
26,6,Stripper 1,"Hey, what the fuck!
"
26,6,Randy,"What?
"
26,6,Fineski,"Hey, you fuck guy! You do not harass the ladies!
"
26,6,Randy,"Well, I wanted strippers, not prudes!
"
26,6,Fineski,"You wanna talk, big man? Huh? You wanna be big man?
"
26,6,Randy,"Whoa, whoa, okay. I think I need to explain something to you, okay? Look, I'm just trying to combat the messages that the liberal left is putting out to young men about their male instincts being toxic.
"
26,6,Fineski,"The fuck you talking?
"
26,6,Randy,"You know, I'm trying to show my son and his nerdy little friend what a real party is, 'cause society wants them to be ashamed of their masculine natures.
"
26,6,Fineski,"You want real party?
"
26,6,Randy,"Yeah! Truth is, I got a whole barn full of weed.
"
26,6,Fineski,"I will call some friends.
"
26,6,Phone,"The person you are trying to reach cannot be located. Please leave a message. 
"
26,6,Rick,"Where are you? I got back from the beach and you were gone. Please pick up!
"
26,6,Garrison,"And we're gonna take Georgia, and we're gonna take Arizona this time!
"
26,6,Garrison,"And when I say we're gonna take Arizona in the election, I mean we're gonna take it again, 'cause we all know I won it last time, too!
"
26,6,Garrison,"Oh. Hey, everybody. This is Rick.
"
26,6,Garrison,"Rick! Rick, will you just wait!
"
26,6,Rick,"You know it's two in the morning? I was alone at the hotel while you were out rallying!
"
26,6,Garrison,"I just wanted to rally for a little bit.
"
26,6,Rick,"Yeah, you really look like you just rallied a little bit.
"
26,6,Garrison,"I got a text that Tucker was in town, and I just wanted to go rally for a little bit.
"
26,6,Rick,"You really think those people care about you, Herb? They don't. They just wanna do that.
"
26,6,Garrison,"Rick, I got it out of my system now. We can still have a great vacation. Let's just start over tomorrow. Okay?
"
26,6,Randy,"Alright, alright, let's do this! Okay, you ready? Three, two, one, go!
"
26,6,Randy,"Check it out, guys!
"
26,6,EMT,"Sir, do you think you can walk?
"
26,6,Randy,"No, I don't think so.
"
26,6,EMT,"Sir, we think you've had too much to drink, and we should probably take you to the hospital.
"
26,6,Randy,"No, I can't. I have to stay here, 'cause I'm in charge of my son. Today's woke culture has vilified his manhood and made him ashamed of himself.
"
26,6,EMT,"Okay, sir, but it appears you have a broken arm and several fractured ribs.
"
26,6,Randy,"Yeah, but I can't leave because my son's natural instincts are being suppressed and it's leading to behavioral problems. You see the shit he's doing? He's over there playing with dolls!
"
26,6,Garrison,"It's pretty good fondue, right?
"
26,6,Rick,"We should probably just go back to the hotel. You've got the shakes from rallying all night.
"
26,6,Garrison,"No, no, Rick. This is our vacation. I want us to have a nice romantic lunch.
"
26,6,Rick,"Maybe we should just go back to Colorado.
"
26,6,Garrison,"No, Rick. I'm gonna make this up to you. I don't want to rally anymore. There's just a lot of people out there who won't let it go, you know?
"
26,6,Rick,"Yes, and you can't be around them!
"
26,6,Garrison,"I know. I know. Let me just go throw up because I'll feel much better.
"
26,6,Rick,"Okay, go throw up, Herb.
"
26,6,Garrison,"Come on, just stop! Stop! The country is fine! You have better things to do!
"
26,6,Garrison,"Yeah! Aw yeah! That's it! Yeah! We're gonna get abortion rights thrown the hell out so those dirty lesbians can't keep having abortions!
"
26,6,Man,"Yeah! Oh, yeah, man!
"
26,6,Garrison,"We're gonna get those Black Lives Matter protestors off the streets with a fire hose!
"
26,6,Man,"Yeah, America! Yeah!
"
26,6,Garrison,"Yeah!
"
26,6,Garrison,"Rick!
"
26,6,Rick,"Fuck you!
"
26,6,Garrison,"Well, to hell with you! Nobody controls me!
"
26,6,Man,"Can I help you?
"
26,6,Female police officer,"We've had some complaints about a party that's been going on for three days here.
"
26,6,Randy,"Hey, what's going on?
"
26,6,Randy,"Alright guys, who ordered the stripper?
"
26,6,Female police officer,"Can we come in and look around, sir?
"
26,6,Randy,"Oh yeah! Come on in!
"
26,6,Randy,"Honk honk!
"
26,6,Female police officer,"Alright, get down on the ground!
"
26,6,Randy,"Whoa, whoa! No, no, no. It's okay. I'm just helping my boy through the media assault on manliness.
"
26,6,Female police officer,"I need to see some ID, sir.
"
26,6,Randy,"Ah! Okay, okay! Stan! Stan!
"
26,6,Stan,"Yeah?
"
26,6,Randy,"Can you get my wallet from the upstairs?
"
26,6,Stan,"Yeah, as soon as we're done with this psyker phase. I have five psyker units.
"
26,6,Randy,"Oh my God. This is so embarrassing!
"
26,6,Male police officer,"Hey! Freeze! You, right there!
"
26,6,Male police officer,"That's Alonzo Fineski, the Romanian sex trafficker!
"
26,6,Fineski,"Fuck you, big man!
"
26,6,Randy,"Stan! Stan!
"
26,6,Announcer,"And now, ladies and gentlemen, here he is, the once and future President of the United States of America!
"
26,6,Garrison,"Thank you. I am here today for those who have been wronged.
"
26,6,Garrison,"For those who have been betrayed. And let me tell you that nobody in this country has been betrayed more than my Ricky Rick.
"
26,6,Garrison,"Rick, I am so sorry. And if you are out there, I want you to know that I love you. You are the only thing that keeps me from doing all this stupid stuff. When I met you, I felt in control of myself for the first time. There has never been anyone who calmed me down more than my little Ricky Bear. You are my boo.
"
26,6,Garrison,"The truth is, some of us simply can't be alone. We need a relationship so that we're accountable to someone. I realize now how broken I am without that person who keeps me from destroying myself.
"
26,6,Randy,"Sh-Sharon?
"
26,6,Garrison,"And all I've ever done was take you for granted and wished I wasn't being controlled.
"
26,6,Randy," Hi, Sharon. Will you please come home?
"
26,6,Garrison,"Rick, I am a giant piece of shit without you. I don't deserve another chance. You have been wronged. You have been betrayed. And the only person who deserves retribution is me. I know you all really want to rally and rage, but the only thing I have to say is that I love Rick. I love Rick! I love Rick!
"
26,6,Crowd," I love Rick!
"
26,6,Garrison,"I love you, Rick!
"
26,6,Capitol Police officer,"Oh, crap. Here we go again!
"
26,6,Sharon,"It's okay, Randy. We're back.
"
26,6,Randy,"I'm sorry I cut your trip short.
"
26,6,Sharon,"It's okay, Randy. You made it longer than last spring break.
"
26,6,Stan,"Oh. Hey, Mom.
"
26,6,Sharon,"Stanley, what have I told you about playing ""Warhammer"" on the kitchen table?
"
26,6,Stan,"Aw!
"
26,6,Garrison,"Oh, Rick!
"
26,6,Garrison,"I don't want to go through all that again. I just want to stay in South Park with you.
"
26,6,Rick,"Well, I guess we'll just have to see what happens.
"
