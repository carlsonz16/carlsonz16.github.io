24,1,Butters,"Hey, Dad, do you think maybe we could go to Build-A-Bear today?
"
24,1,Stephen,"Butters, for the last time, you can't go to Build-A-Bear!
"
24,1,Butters,"But they said they were open again, so I-
"
24,1,Stephen,"Yes, they're open, but we are not the Johnsons, and we do not go to nonessential businesses when it's nonessential!  Hey, do you people mind?! You're supposed to wear your mask over your nose. Looks like you're wearing a diaper for your chin. Chin diapers don't help.  What the? What's going on now?!
"
24,1,Roger Donovan,"Something at the town square. Everyone's gathering!
"
24,1,Stephen,"Well are we protesting or are we rioting?
"
24,1,Roger,"No no, it's something to do with the pandemic. Something big is going on.
"
24,1,Stephen,"Stay here, Butters. 
"
24,1,Randy,"Hey everybody. Can everyone hear me okay? Thanks for turning out, everyone. You know, we've all been through a lot these past several months. We've shut down and people have lost their businesses, lost their livelihoods. I also own a small business. I sell weed, and I have to say ... I'm actually doing pretty good. Amazing.  Tegridy Farms weed has seen a 400% increase in sales since the shutdown in March. I see Thomas Turner out there . Thomas opened a restaurant in SoDoSoPa... doesn't seem like such a good idea now, does it, Turner?  And there's Marley Jarvis, who owned and operated her own tanning salon. Whoops. But I just can't stand here and gloat, because Tegridy Weed is about giving back to people. And that's very proud to announce... that Tegridy Weed is having a Pandemic Special!  And all-new hybrid of our best weed sold at nearly 10% off our usual price. Not only that, but when you buy three pounds or more of the Pandemic Special you get a complimentary Pandemic 2020 bong . We are a community. Let's all be together... with Tegridy. 
"
24,1,Randy,"I think people are really excited. What do you think?
"
24,1,Sharon,"A pandemic special, Randy?! Really?!
"
24,1,Randy,"What?
"
24,1,Sharon,"People are hurting! People are dying, Randy! And all you can think about is making a special about it?
"
24,1,Randy," I'm doing positive to try and help. People really need this right now.
"
24,1,Sharon,"You are a child, Randy! These are very serious times and nobody wants or cares about your stupid special right now!
"
24,1,Randy," We'll see if they like my special.
"
24,1,Cartman,"Wow! 

Another day inside, don't have to do a thing. I love you, social distancing.
No one's around, no one's talking to me. Social distancing, I'm free!
Don't have to brush my teeth or shower. For what?
I can sit on the toilet for hours. As long as I want.
'Cause no one's saying to me ""You kids should go outside and do something.""


 Oh! 9:00 A.M. Time for school! 

"
24,1,Mrs. Nelson,"Good morning, guys. Everyone ready to start school?  
"
24,1,Clyde,"Good morning.
"
24,1,Wendy,"Hello.
"
24,1,Kyle,"Hi.
"
24,1,Sef Furman,"Hello.
"
24,1,Stan,"I'm, I'm here.
"
24,1,Mrs. Nelson,"Okay, I think we're all here. I see Jimmy and Clyde are on now. Eric, are you there?
"
24,1,Cartman,"Yes, teacher, I'm here. I can't wait to start  schoo... schoo... schoo... oo... oo...
"
24,1,Mrs. Nelson,"Oh, no, Eric, I think your computer is freezing up again. 
"
24,1,Cartman,"Oh, no? Can you guys hear me? I just said eh... eh... eh... eh...
"
24,1,Mrs. Nelson,"Eric, you'll just have to listen again, okay? Best you can. So let's start today, guys, by going over yesterday's grammar examples.  Wendy, can you read the first one?
"
24,1,Cartman,"
I'm cut off from the world, isolated, alone. This is what I can existencing. No one can touch me or boss me around. Social distancing-

 
"
24,1,Liane," Eric, aren't you supposed to be on your Zoom call?
"
24,1,Cartman," 
Stay away from me, Mom, yeah. You've got to keep your social distance. 'Cause all I'm gonna do is sing about how much I love you and need you, social distancing

 
"
24,1,Liane,"Sweetie, I know these are challenging times.
"
24,1,Cartman,"Yeah Social distancing, Mom.
"
24,1,Liane,"But we all still have to try and do our work.
"
24,1,Cartman," Computer keeps freezing, Mom. Maybe, if you were an essential worker, we could afford faster Internet.
"
24,1,Liane,"I at least need you to get some of your homework done, okay? And then m-maybe take a shower.
"
24,1,Cartman,"Oh, what a folly a shower seems when my generation is being denied their lives. I can't see my friends. I can't even go to school. How I miss Kyle. Heh heh heh heh.
"
24,1,Liane,"Sweetie, it's all going to be over soon. They're actually talking about school opening up again in a few days! 
"
24,1,Cartman,"What... the fuck... are you talking about?
"
24,1,Liane,"There's going to be a big meeting. Sounds like they're trying to get you, kids, back in school!
"
24,1,Cartman,"We can't go back to school: there's a fucking pandemic.
"
24,1,Liane,"But they're talking about maybe staggering you kids every other day.
"
24,1,Cartman,"They can't do that!
"
24,1,Liane,"Eric, you're going to be able to be with all the other kids again!
"
24,1,Cartman,"Oh no, I see! There's all this horrible stuff going on in the world, but apparently, Cartman's life doesn't matter! 
"
24,1,Liane," Eric, you can't-
"
24,1,Cartman," Ahp! Get back! Get back! 6 feet, Mom! 6 fucking feet! 
"
24,1,Randy," Okay, thank you very much! Hope you enjoy the Pandemic Special!  Hi, you here for the special? Here you go.
"
24,1,Sharon,"How was school, Stanley?
"
24,1,Stan,"It's not school! It's a freakin' joke. We're not even learning anything.
"
24,1,Sharon,"I know this has all been really hard on you, Stanley. Do you wanna talk about it?
"
24,1,Stan,"No, I'm fine, Mom! You know, I'm strong. I'm just worried about how this is all affecting weaker kids like, you know, like Butters.
"
24,1,Sharon,"Yeah. Well, it's nice you care about our friend, but if you need to talk... I know this is really hard on everyone.
"
24,1,Randy," Well, that's it, guys. We have run out of weed for the day.  Oh, hang on. Sorry, uh, didn't somebody say the pandemic special was a bad idea?
"
24,1,Sharon,"I wasn't saying you wouldn't make money, I was saying maybe that's not what should matter right now!
"
24,1,Randy,"Oh, come on, think about it. Do you even know anyone personally who's dying of COVID?
"
24,1,Sharon,"Yes! My brother Jimbo, who is in the hospital!
"
24,1,Stan,"Yeah, Uncle Jimbo.
"
24,1,Randy,"Jimbo's a fat alcoholic who'd be in the hospital anyway. All I'm saying is that we let some dirty virus from ""China"" completely upend our lives and shut us down!
"
24,1,Sharon,"Please do not quote the President in front of our child!
"
24,1,Randy,"Sharon, I went to China, remember? Last season? I went there to sell our weed and ended up hanging out with Disney and Mickey Mouse. You remember all that? I know what China's like. Doesn't surprise me all this shit came from there.
"
24,1,Shelly," We're going back to school!
"
24,1,Sharon,"What?
"
24,1,Shelly," They're gonna let us go back to school! 
"
24,1,Anchor Tom,"The Park County School District is holding a parent meeting tomorrow, and officials are hopeful that students can return to school on Monday.
"
24,1,Stan,"Wow, that's great!
"
24,1,Sharon,"Oh, I don't know if this is a good idea.
"
24,1,Anchor Tom,"The openings come on the heels that scientists are getting closer to finding the origins of the COVID pandemic
"
24,1,Chief Scientist,"Y-yes, we've been able to trace the virus and confirm that it did, in fact, come from a seedy part of China.
"
24,1,Randy,"HA. Told ya! 
"
24,1,Chief Scientist,"And, in fact, we've pinpointed the virus to a certain bat in Wuhan.
"
24,1,Randy," A bat in Wuhan?
"
24,1,Chief Scientist,"What we still don't understand is, how did a transmitted disease get from a bat to a human? How can a virus jump species like that? We just don't know.
"
24,1,Randy,"Hello. Oh, Oh hey!  You could use some, Tegridy, China! 
"
24,1,Mickey Mouse,"Here's to China! Haha.
"
24,1,Randy,"To China!
"
24,1,Randy,"Boy, you sure know how to party, Mick!
"
24,1,Mickey,"Oh my God! Look at her! Haha! She's so hot! 
"
24,1,Randy,"I think that's a bat.
"
24,1,Mickey,"Yeah! It's a bat! It's a mouse, with wings!
"
24,1,Randy,"Hey, Mick? Where'd you go? 
"
24,1,Mickey,"Haha, haha. Oh boy!
"
24,1,Randy,"Oooh!
"
24,1,Mickey,"Haha! Randy, you gotta try it! Go ahead, take a turn!
"
24,1,Randy,"
"
24,1,Stan,"If they're letting us go back to school, then soon we can get back to everything! I mean, doesn't this mean things are finally going back to normal? Dad?
"
24,1,Randy,"I gotta go! 
"
24,1,Mickey,"Then sell fucking Epcot Center! If we can't get people on the rides, then sell the fuckin' thing!  No, no, no! I said MORE Mandalorian!  Jesus Christ! We're fucking dying here!  What?! Fucking what?! Haha.
"
24,1,Randy,"Hey, it's Randy Marsh From, from Tegridy Farms?
"
24,1,Mickey,"What do you want, Marsh?! I'm in the fucking weeds here!
"
24,1,Randy,"Look, um, do you remember when we fucked that bat in Wuhan?
"
24,1,Mickey,"I've fucked a lot of bats!
"
24,1,Randy,"Well, I've only fucked one! I remember. Right after, I got really sick, and this was all back in October.
"
24,1,Mickey,"Jesus Christ, you fucker! You started all this!
"
24,1,Randy,"You told me to fuck the bat!
"
24,1,Mickey,"You didn't quarantine yourself after you got home?!
"
24,1,Randy,"Nobody knew anything about COVID when I fucked the bat! I thought I just came back from China with the flu! Look, we can't let scientists find that bat. My wife is crazy. If she finds out I started the pandemic, she's gonna be a total bitch about it. 
"
24,1,Cartman,"Dude, you are not gonna believe this.
"
24,1,Kyle,"What are you doing here??
"
24,1,Cartman," Is your dad home, Kyle? We need to talk to a lawyer! Mr. Broflovski?!
"
24,1,Kyle,"Dude, get out of my house! If you wanna talk, we can go outside!
"
24,1,Cartman,"They're gonna try and make us go back to school.
"
24,1,Kyle," Dude, you could be spreading germs! 
"
24,1,Cartman,"Maybe you didn't hear me, Kyle! They want us to go back. To school!
"
24,1,Kyle,"So?
"
24,1,Cartman,"""So?"" What the fuck is-? You really wanna go back to that slavery?!
"
24,1,Kyle,"I want an education! I want to be able to compete for a job when I get older!
"
24,1,Cartman,"You crazy, psychotic... Kyle, we need to get a lawyer to stop schools from forcing us back! Now, whatever your messed-up beliefs are about ""wanting to go to school""
"
24,1,Kyle,"You really wanna spend the next year on Zoom?
"
24,1,Cartman,"You don't have to be on Zoom, there's a million ways around it! Mark my words, Kyle: first they'll force us back to school, then they'll take social distancing away from us completely, and I'll be out of my room having to hang out with you!
"
24,1,Kyle,"You're out of your room hanging out with me now!
"
24,1,Cartman," Oh my God. They won't get away with this!
"
24,1,Man with Orange Shirt,"Hey! Excuse me , y-you're Randy Marsh, right?
"
24,1,Randy,"Uh... m-maybe.
"
24,1,Man with Orange Shirt,"Yeah. Look man, I just wanna say thanks, you know? The Pandemic special is really amazing.
"
24,1,Randy,"Oh, yeah. Cool. Thank you.
"
24,1,Man with Orange Shirt,"Nono, listen. You... you're awesome! All this horrible stuff going on and... well, you come along and try to fight it!
"
24,1,Randy,"Okay, thanks.
"
24,1,Man with Orange Shirt,"Y-you see, I... I lost my wife... to the virus. My kids, I... I don't even know how to talk to them, you know. Just... just thank God for your Pandemic Special. Thank God. It's a great special, it really is.
"
24,1,Randy,"Okay.
"
24,1,Man with Orange Shirt,"No, it's an awesome special. And i-and it was a great idea to do a special.
"
24,1,Randy,"Okay okay, just stop! 
"
24,1,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, welcome, parents, to this all-school town meeting to talk about how we're gonna get your kids back into the classroom. Can everyone hear me okay?  Okay, well, parents, we've made some amazing adjustments and hirings, m'kay? We believe we can welcome students back on Monday. M'kay?
"
24,1,Sheila,"How are you going to do this?
"
24,1,Stephen,"Yeah, what happens when my son is sitting in a room with Craig Tucker, whose father doesn't even wear a mask outside?
"
24,1,Thomas,"Oh, here we fucking go again! Stop mask shaming, Stotch!
"
24,1,Stephen,"Well, it's really not a mask if you wear it down around your chin. That's a chin diaper.
"
24,1,Thomas,"There's no real proof that a mask even fuckin' does anything!
"
24,1,Stephen,"Spoken like a true redneck!
"
24,1,Carol McCormick,"Oh, fuck you! 
"
24,1,Mr. Mackey,"Okay. Okay, everyone. Alright.  M'kay! I just muted everybody! Okay! Now, if we don't get along, I'll just sit here with you all on mute!  Okay, now let's try this again. 
"
24,1,Mrs. Tweek,"I saw Wendy's mother not wearing a mask in the changing room at Ross.
"
24,1,Mrs. Testaburger,"The fuck are you doing spying on me in the changing room?! I was at Ross- 
"
24,1,Mr. Mackey,"Okay, BOOM!  You're all muted! M'kay?! I can do this all day! Now, we've made changes at the school, and we feel prepared to welcome your students back!  Mr. Donovan!
"
24,1,Roger,"I don't care what changes you've made, my son Clyde is not going to class!
"
24,1,Mr. Mackey,"And that is your prerogative. Mute!  Mmkay, Mrs. Marsh.
"
24,1,Sharon,"I thought that the issue was the teachers not coming back.
"
24,1,Mr. Mackey,"That is correct. Our teaching staff does not feel safe to return, BUT... we have hired all new teachers, m'kay? These are people who have recently lost their jobs due to recent events and are desperate for work. Mmkay, so they'll do just about anything.
"
24,1,Stephen,"What new teachers?
"
24,1,Yates,"Alright, men! As you all know, due to recent events totally beyond our control, we have lost most of our funding. But this new venture will be great. and I know we will all thrive as elementary schoolteachers. This might be our last chance at a job, so I don't want any unnecessary deaths.  Ahp! Ahp! No unnecessary deaths! And let's show this town just what great leaders we can be. This is gonna be great.
"
24,1,Anchor Tom,"All over South Park this morning, children are getting ready for their first day of class. And as they do, scientists say they're closer to finding a vaccine.
"
24,1,Stan,"Oh cool! Turn it up!
"
24,1,Bill Keegan,"Tom, I'm standing in front of the newly built viral research center where scientists say they have found the animal which started the coronavirus.  The creature was located in China and then flown to the facility here, where scientists are studying it thoroughly.
"
24,1,Randy," Heyheyhey, whoa whoa! W-what are you guys doing?!
"
24,1,Stan,"They think they're about to find the vaccine.
"
24,1,Chief Scientist,"Yes, now that we have the animal in our possession, we'll finally be able to unlock what caused a virus to jump from it to humans.
"
24,1,Randy," Does it matter what started coronavirus?! Who cares what started coronavirus?! You guys are being racist! We don't need to watch this! Where's the remote?  This is... this is racist television and we're not gonna watch it! 
"
24,1,Sharon,"I want to hear this, Randy!
"
24,1,Randy,"No! No. You know what? You guys are horrible! Just, just stop it right now!
"
24,1,Bill Keegan,"You traced the virus to Wuhan, but what you found was not a bat. Is that correct?
"
24,1,Chief Scientist,"Nono, the virus did not come from a bat.
"
24,1,Randy,"You guys-  What? What did he say?
"
24,1,Chief Scientist,"We were able to break down the virus enough to see there was actually no bat involved.
"
24,1,Randy,"No bat involved. No bat involved!  Oh yeah! Oh yeah! It wasn't a bat! It wasn't a bat! It wasn't a bat! In your face! In your face! It wasn't a bat!
"
24,1,Chief Scientist,"When we tracked the virus, we found it did originate in Wuhan, but from a species called pholidota.
"
24,1,Bill Keegan,"And what exactly is pholidota?
"
24,1,Chief Scientist,"It's a pangolin. And here it is, right over here. 
"
24,1,Stan,"What's a pangolin, Mom?
"
24,1,Sharon,"I'm not even sure. Do you know what a pangolin is, Randy?  Randy?
"
24,1,Stan,"Do you know what a pangolin is, Dad?
"
24,1,Mickey,"Haha haha. Dude, I still can't believe you fucked that bat. Haha.
"
24,1,Randy,"Okaaay, okaaay, Shhhh.
"
24,1,Mickey,"Haha. You really let her have it! Oh boy!
"
24,1,Randy,"Okay! I don't wanna think about that right now, Mickey!
"
24,1,Mickey,"I'm just impressed, that's all. I mean, if you can handle a bat, then...
"
24,1,Randy,"Then what?
"
24,1,Mickey,"You ever have sex with a pangolin?
"
24,1,Randy,"What the fuck is a pangolin? 
"
24,1,Randy,"Ha ha, ha whoa!  Shit! 
"
24,1,Yates,"Alright, children, welcome back to class. I'm your new teacher, Detective Harris, and this is our homeroom teacher's assistant, Officer Johnston. Let's start the day off with some math. Does anyone understand math? Who would like to lead the class with some math? 
"
24,1,Cartman,"Pandemic! There's a pandemic! You can't make me go to school!  You can't! Argh! Araraaagh! No, no, no! No, no, no! You can't make me! You hear me?!
"
24,1,Yates,"I don't know if I can do this, Mitch. I fucking hate kids. I can't be a teacher.
"
24,1,Mitch,"It's all we got, sir  Let me try. Kids! Alright, come on! Let's settle down! Now we're gonna do some fingerpaints. You got that? You're gonna fingerpaint...  a marsupial of your choice or a fun thing you did over the summer.
"
24,1,Cartman,"You can't make us stay here! This is a violation of our freedom! Who's with me, guys?!
"
24,1,Mitch,"Now, listen! We're gonna start fingerpaintin' right now!
"
24,1,Cartman,"Oh my God, I forgot how much it sucks to be around everybody! I think I'm gonna be sick, all over Kyle! 
"
24,1,Kyle,"Fuck you! 
"
24,1,Mitch,"That's enough! 
"
24,1,Tolkien,"Ow! 
"
24,1,Yates,"Got him!
"
24,1,Chief Scientist," And here it is. This is the pangolin we tracked down in China, the animal that could lead us to a vaccine. The mysteries of COVID can be unlocked by our studies of this creature. I'll just ask you all to keep a good distance away. Obviously, we can't let anything happen to this pangolin.  You see, this pangolin's DNA has mutated, which is what we believe started it all.
"
24,1,Scientist 1,"The pangolin has mutated, how?
"
24,1,Chief Scientist,"We're not completely sure, but we believe now that something somehow... got its DNA up into the pangolin.
"
24,1,Scientist 2,"How exactly could that happen?
"
24,1,Chief Scientist,"Well i-it's almost like another creature somehow inserted its DNA up into the pangolin.
"
24,1,Scientist 3,"Perhaps some other species somehow mated with the pangolin?
"
24,1,Scientist 2,"Oh, come on! What kind of animal would have sex with a pangolin?
"
24,1,Scientist 1,"Yeah! Look how ugly that thing is!
"
24,1,Scientists," Yeah, yeah.
"
24,1,Randy,"Okay, Okay.
"
24,1,Chief Scientist,"Again, what really matters is that we decode the foreign DNA inside the pangolin. That would be the key to the vaccine, perhaps even a cure. We have to know what raped the pangolin.
"
24,1,Randy,"Oh, so now it was ""rape.""
"
24,1,Chief Scientist,"Excuse me, sir. Who are you?  This tour is for scientists that specialize in pandemics. Are you... a pandemic specialist?
"
24,1,Randy,"Yeah I'm a pandemic specialist. I'm making one right now.
"
24,1,Chief Scientist,"Uh-kay. Anyway, if you all follow me now to the micro labs, I can show you the containment system for once a vaccine is able to be tried. 
"
24,1,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay. mmkay, parents? Can everyone hear me okay?  Everyone listens up. We don't want anyone to panic, okay, but there has been a COVID exposure here at the school.  Okay, one of our fourth graders was taken to the hospital a couple of hours ago, okay? But we think Tolkien's gonna be okay. Now, due to county protocol, everyone that was in the school now has to quarantine for two weeks. So we will be keeping your kids here, and the teachers will be staying with them. 
"
24,1,Yates,"Alright, students. shut up.  I know this situation is not ideal, but we all have to quarantine together for two weeks.
"
24,1,Cartman,"This is bullshit!
"
24,1,Yates,"You don't want to infect your families, do you? You were all exposed to a student here who was taken to the hospital due to COVID. Yes?
"
24,1,Stan,"Uh, we were there, and Token was actually taken to the hospital because you guys shot him.
"
24,1,Yates,"Yes, due to COVID. If it weren't for COVID, all the previous teachers would have still been here, we wouldn't have been in the class, and nobody would have gotten shot. Therefore, the young man is in the hospital due to COVID.
"
24,1,Officer 1,"It was COVID-related.
"
24,1,Stan,"That doesn't make any sense!
"
24,1,Newsman,"And scientists are asking all South Park County residents to keep an eye out for the creature. Once again, the pangolin escaped from the facility yesterday, and many people are fearing the worst. Scientists say that even though they have samples from the pangolin, they now don't have what they need for a vaccine.
"
24,1,Chief Scientist,"Yes. You see, what we needed was the foreign DNA that was up inside the pangolin. It's whatever that DNA was that was our key to the cure. 
"
24,1,Delivery Express Man,"Hello! Anyone home??  Got a delivery here. Needs a signature.
"
24,1,Randy," Oh, okay.
"
24,1,Delivery Express Man,"Oh, he-hey, if you're gonna come any closer, would you mind wearing a, you know, chin diaper?
"
24,1,Randy,"Oh, sorry. 
"
24,1,Delivery Express Man,"Here you go. Just sign right there.  Have a nice day.  Oh, and hey, I'm really loving the pandemic special.
"
24,1,Randy,"Yeah thanks. 
"
24,1,Randy,"Why did you send that to me?
"
24,1,Mickey,"Haha. Because you're a dead man, Marsh. It's your DNA that they need for a vaccine! Haha!
"
24,1,Randy,"Yeah, I know, but I can't just turn myself in!
"
24,1,Mickey,"This isn't personal, Marsh. It's business. I'm having you killed, then secretly we'll send your DNA to the scientists for the vaccine. Haha.
"
24,1,Randy,"This is all your fault, Mickey Mouse! You made the deal with the devil when you sold your Mulan shit to China! And then you took me out and sold me on how great China was, and how we should all suck their dick! You made me lose my tegridy and anything special that I had-!  Special. Wait a minute. That's it!
"
24,1,Mickey,"What's it? Haha.
"
24,1,Randy,"The Special. The Pandemic Special! That's how we can get my DNA into people! We can vaccinate them without them even knowing!
"
24,1,Mickey,"What are you talkin' about?
"
24,1,Randy,"Just give me a couple of more days before you have me killed. I-I think I know a way out of this.
"
24,1,Jimbo,"Randy?
"
24,1,Randy,"Shhh. Hey Jimbo.
"
24,1,Jimbo,"Wha-what are you-?
"
24,1,Randy,"It's okay, Jimbo. I think I might have a cure for COVID.  You're just gonna have to trust me, okay? 
"
24,1,Jimbo,"Uh, uh...
"
24,1,Randy,"Shhhh, this is gonna be great.
"
24,1,Jimbo,"No, uh... 
"
24,1,Randy,"It's okay, it's okay. Just breathe. Breeeathe.  It's okay. It's okay, breathe.
"
24,1,Mr. McArthur," We miss you, honey. We can't wait for quarantine to be over! Huh.
"
24,1,Officer 2,"Group 4, your meal is over! Back to your class! 
"
24,1,Officer 3,"Alright. Group 5, it's now mealtime. Come in, but keep your social distance.  Yeah, that's good social distancing. Real good.
"
24,1,Butters," March 16th. It was March 16th! That's how long it's been! It was supposed to be a party! A big, happy gathering at Build-A-Bear to celebrate me being a big boy at the dentist! Then they shut it all down. They said I'd have to wait until April. And then it was May. And then they said, ""Wait until summer."" It's fucking October now!  Why doesn't anyone tell me the truth?!  That I'm never going to Build-A-Bear!  That I'm never going ever again!
"
24,1,Stan," Butters, Butters, you gotta calm down.
"
24,1,Butters,"I'm never going to Build-A-Bear, am I?!  Oh, hey teachers. Sorry.  W-wait, I'm sorry. I don't need to go to Build-A-Bear! Fellas?! 
"
24,1,Sharon,"Randy? Where are the car keys? Randy!
"
24,1,Randy,"Huh? Uh, what? What?
"
24,1,Sharon,"Where are the car keys?
"
24,1,Randy,"They're probably in my pants pocket. Why?
"
24,1,Sharon,"I have to get over to the hospital.
"
24,1,Randy,"The hospital? For what?
"
24,1,Sharon,"It's Jimbo. Doctor said he's better, so I can take him home.
"
24,1,Randy,"Jimbo's better?
"
24,1,Sharon,"They said he doesn't have any symptoms, and his tests are showing negative.
"
24,1,Randy,"Holy shit. 
"
24,1,Randy,"It works. It can help.  Hoh boy. 
"
24,1,Stan,"Kyle, I need to talk to you.
"
24,1,Kyle,"Hey dude.
"
24,1,Stan,"I'm really worried. About Butters. I think he's sick.
"
24,1,Kyle,"You think he got the virus?
"
24,1,Stan,"No! It's all the other stuff. The isolation and the uncertainty.  I'm just really worried what all the stuff around COVID is doing to some kids. You know, not every kid is like us. There's some kids who really can't take it anymore.
"
24,1,Kyle,"I know. This bullshit sucks. But Butters will be okay.
"
24,1,Stan," And what if he's not? What if Butters is actually starting to lose his mind? What if he feels his body shutting down right now?
"
24,1,Kyle,"You really think it's that bad?
"
24,1,Stan,"It's time for us to ask for help. From someone who has more authority at this school than these cops.
"
24,1,Male Aide 1,"Mr. President, the CDC is on the line. They need to speak with you urgently!
"
24,1,Mr. Garrison,"Tell them to suck my asshole.
"
24,1,Female Aide,"Mr. President, Dr. Fauci is on line 2 and the FDA chief is on line 3.
"
24,1,Mr. Garrison,"Ooo! Tell Fauci to shove it up his ass, and let the FDA chief know he can eat shit off my balls.
"
24,1,Male Aide 2,"Sir! Sir, you have an urgent call on line 4 from a Mr. Slave?
"
24,1,Mr. Garrison," Mr. Slave? Okay, go, go, go, go!  Yes, this is the President of the entire United States.
"
24,1,Stan,"Uh, hi, it's Stan Marsh.
"
24,1,Mr. Garrison,"Stan Marsh? Where's Mr. Slave?
"
24,1,Stan,"I'm sorry. We had to get your attention. Listen, we're being kept at the school, and one of the students here is really sick.
"
24,1,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, for Pete's sake, here we go again.  Just deal with it. I am busy.
"
24,1,Stan,"No, no, Mr. President, please! You gotta come back to South Park. Our teachers are shooting people. Everyone's arguing and, and there's a facility outside of town that found the pangolin and are working on a vaccine! You might be able to stop the pandemic.
"
24,1,Mr. Garrison,"Why would I do that?
"
24,1,Stan,"...Huh?
"
24,1,Mr. Garrison,"Stan, this is gonna be very difficult for a child to understand, but I made a promise to the American people- to get rid of all the Mexicans.
"
24,1,Stan,"But the pandemic isn't just killing Mexicans.
"
24,1,Mr. Garrison,"It's killing a lot of them. I've gone over the statistics, Stan.  All I have to do now is sort of guide the avalanche in the right direction, and I'm fulfilling my promises to the American People. I was doing a crap job until this pandemic happened.
"
24,1,Stan,"You're just gonna sit there and not do anything?!
"
24,1,Mr. Garrison,"I am going to actively not do anything. And you can eat shit off my balls and die. 
"
24,1,Stan,"God dammit!
"
24,1,Randy,"Ogh. Ogh-o.  Okay, there you go. That's all I can sell you right now. Just make sure you smoke it, okay? Enjoy the special.  Han-hang on, guys. I gotta prep some more. Just give me like 4 minutes. 
"
24,1,Sharon," Randy?!
"
24,1,Randy,"Ogh.
"
24,1,Sharon,"Randy?!
"
24,1,Randy,"Just...  what?!
"
24,1,Sharon,"Randy, you've gotta get in here!
"
24,1,Randy,"I'm doing something important, Sharon! People need this right now!
"
24,1,Sharon,"Come upstairs. Something's wrong with Jimbo!  He's just been sleeping for days.  They said he was getting better.  Last night his fever came back. And then a few hours ago, this thing appeared on his face.
"
24,1,Randy,"What thing? 
"
24,1,Sharon,"Jimbo's never been able to grow a mustache.
"
24,1,Randy,"Huh. That's weird.
"
24,1,Sharon,"Should I call the doctor?
"
24,1,Randy,"No! Nonono! Don't call the doctor! They're busy. These are u-un- precedented times. W-we have no idea what caused this.
"
24,1,Jimbo," Special...
"
24,1,Sharon,"What, Jimbo?
"
24,1,Jimbo,"Pandemic... uh special...
"
24,1,Sharon," Why's he talking about your special?
"
24,1,Randy," Everyone's talking about the special, Sharon. It's a big deal. He obviously needs it right now.
"
24,1,Sharon,"I'm gonna get the thermometer. 
"
24,1,Randy," Just fucking shut up! You have no idea if it's because of the special. You could just be sick again 'cause you're a fat, fucking alcoholic, and I am not going to jail for you! 
"
24,1,Dr. Doctor,"And you say you've never had a mustache before?
"
24,1,Gerald,"No! Never! It just came outta nowhere!
"
24,1,Sheila,"How can this happen, Doctor?
"
24,1,Dr. Doctor,"Have you put anything toxic in your body lately? Any drugs or alcohol?
"
24,1,Gerald,"No! I mean... I've enjoyed a little of the Pandemic Special...
"
24,1,Dr. Doctor,"Oh, nonono. That-that's totally fine.
"
24,1,Nurse,"Doctor? You better come to the emergency room! 
"
24,1,Dr. Doctor,"Holy shit!
"
24,1,Anchor Tom,"Another strain of COVID, or simply more COVID-related symptoms? A reported 1 in 10 people in Park County are experiencing mustaches, and nobody seems to know why. The Mayor has called for help from infectious disease experts, and Dr. Anthony Fauci arrived at South park Hospital today to give his advice.
"
24,1,Dr. Fauci,"We aren't sure why some people are getting a mustache and some aren't, but we have to do all we can to avoid it becoming fashionable.
"
24,1,Man 1,"Will our chin diapers keep us safe?
"
24,1,Dr. Fauci,"Yes, but we must wear them where the mustache would be. We need to wear them over our mouth and nose.
"
24,1,Stephen,"Are you out of your mind? You expect people to wear a diaper over their nose? That's disgusting! Fuck you, Fauci!
"
24,1,Anchor Tom,"Citizens are asked to stay indoors and just try and relax, and maybe enjoy some of the Pandemic Special.
"
24,1,Randy,"Nooo! Shit! 
"
24,1,Officer 4,"Nice. 
"
24,1,Stan,"Butters. Butters!
"
24,1,Butters,"Wha?
"
24,1,Stan,"Don't worry. I'm going to save you!
"
24,1,Butters,"Okay. Save me from what? 
"
24,1,Stan,"Guys, guys! 
"
24,1,Students,"What? Who is it?
"
24,1,Stan,"Shhh. You guys, we have to get Butters out of here.
"
24,1,Kyle,"Who else can we call, Stan?
"
24,1,Stan,"No! We have to get him out of here! Now! We need to take him... to Build-A-Bear.
"
24,1,Craig,"Are you nuts??
"
24,1,Stan,"He has to go out and do something normal!
"
24,1,Jimmy,"Stan, Build-A-Bear is currently by appointment only, and only a maximum party of 4 can visit at one time.
"
24,1,Stan,"We can't wait around and wait for people to figure things out, okay?! It's not gonna happen! They just keep taking everything from him and saying it's for his own good! But who's to say he can't go out and have a little goddamn fun?! If we want things to go back to normal, then we just gotta go do it!
"
24,1,Cartman," Stan's right. If we want things to go back to normal, we have to do it ourselves.
"
24,1,Stan,"They're just gonna be making more restrictions, and more rules, and who's gonna fight to go back to the way things were?
"
24,1,Cartman,"I sure as hell will!
"
24,1,Stan,"We can make things normal for Butters again, and make school the way it was!
"
24,1,Cartman,"The way it was! Online, in our own rooms!
"
24,1,Stan,"Wait, what? No, in a class, with real teachers!
"
24,1,Cartman,"Wait, what? What normal are you talking about?
"
24,1,Stan,"I'm talking about normal, like back in March. What normal are you talking about?
"
24,1,Cartman,"I'm talking about normal, like three days ago, when everything was awesome.
"
24,1,Stan,"Look it doesn't matter. We just gotta break the fuck out of here.
"
24,1,Timmy,"TIMMAH! 
"
24,1,Anchor Tom,"The new outbreak in South Park is spreading rapidly, and as highways into town close and governments consider a full lockdown, one question is on everyone's mind: where is the damn pangolin?! Some speculate the pangolin took its own life, while others think that-  Sorry. Sorry, we're getting some breaking news. Oh, God. Students at South Park Elementary have broken quarantine and are now out on the loose!
"
24,1,Bill Keegan," The fugitives broke out sometime last night. Teachers are reporting there's no cause for alarm, except that these children have all been exposed to COVID  and could be running around spreading mustaches right now!
"
24,1,Woman," Aaaaaaaaow! 
"
24,1,Man 2,"Super-spreaders! 
"
24,1,Stocker," One can of shaving cream per family! 
"
24,1,Stephen," Butters?! Butters, you get back to quarantine or you are gonna be grounded!
"
24,1,Thomas,"Hey, Stotch!  You heard what the scientist said! Get your diaper up over your mustache area!
"
24,1,Stephen,"I'm not wearing a damn diaper over my nose!
"
24,1,Mrs. Testaburger,"Don't you care about people?
"
24,1,Stephen,"Yeah, we care way more about what's right than you do, bitch!  Oh! 
"
24,1,Mayor McDaniels,"For Christ's sake, the entire town is in chaos! How the hell did you let those kids out of quarantine?!
"
24,1,Yates," Don't blame this on us teachers! You opened the school and gave us barely enough resources to do our job!
"
24,1,Mayor McDaniels,"Everyone is terrified of catching something from these super-spreaders!
"
24,1,Yates,"Well, I don't know what you're gonna do, Mayor. You took all our funding away. You said our equipment was too extreme. Now, if we had some of that stuff back...
"
24,1,Officer 1,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
"
24,1,Yates,"Tsst-tst-tst-ch-ch-ch!
"
24,1,Mayor McDaniels,"We certainly don't want you, teachers, to be without every resource available. I'll write an executive order to get you everything you need.
"
24,1,Yates," Boys? We are back in business!
"
24,1,Officers," YEAH! YEAH! YEAH! YEAH! YEAH!...
"
24,1,Yates,"Possible COVID exposure at 4:00!  You there.  You are violating a mandated safer-inside order! Put down the snowball and get back to quarantine!  We've got a runner! 
"
24,1,Stan,"Okay, all clear! Come on! Go go go!  All right, you ready to have some fun, Butters?
"
24,1,Butters,"I sure am, fellas!
"
24,1,Kyle,"Okay!
"
24,1,Stan,"Shit shit, get back, back, back, back, back!  Okay, all good. Come on. 
"
24,1,Kyle,"Dude, we made it.
"
24,1,Stan,"Butters, Butters.  Look! 
"
24,1,Butters,"Whoa! Is it really for reals?
"
24,1,Stan,"Yeah, it's real. Come on! We got an appointment!  Oh, uh hey, excuse me. We had an appointment.
"
24,1,James,"Oh no, s-sorry. We're closed.
"
24,1,Stan,"But I called. Y-you said you were open today for appointments.
"
24,1,James,"Yeah, we had to shut down again. Somebody came into the store with a mustache.
"
24,1,Kyle,"A mustache?
"
24,1,Stan,"Ple-hease, my friend has to build a bear.
"
24,1,James," I'm sorry! These are unprecedented times!
"
24,1,Stan,"Ohoh, just give us one minute!
"
24,1,Butters,"Oh! Good job, Stan! Thanks for getting my hopes up, you asshole!
"
24,1,Kyle," Come on, dude. We'd better get outta here before we're spotted.
"
24,1,Stan,"We can't go.
"
24,1,Kyle,"What do you mean?
"
24,1,Stan,"We don't have a choice. We're gonna have to break in.
"
24,1,Kyle,"And then do what?
"
24,1,Stan,"And then build him a bear.
"
24,1,Cartman,"Without any employees? What, do you expect us to just, just... build our own bear?
"
24,1,Stan,"If we have to, yes!
"
24,1,Kyle,"Dude, you need people to help you do the stuffing and the closing. You don't- you don't actually build your own bear.
"
24,1,Stan,"I don't care! I'm not following the rules anymore!
"
24,1,Sharon,"What the hell are you doing?!
"
24,1,Randy,"I just... gotta take all the Pandemic Special over to Thompson Lake and dump it.
"
24,1,Sharon,"Dump it? Why are you worrying about this right now?!
"
24,1,Randy,"Because the Pandemic Special needs to end! A special has to end, Sharon, or else it's not really a ""special,"" is it?! 
"
24,1,Sharon,"Goddammit, Randy, our son is out in this chaos!  This is not the time for you to be dealing with your fucking marijuana!  Somebody's gotta find him! 
"
24,1,Randy,"No, no, okay, okay, okay, hold on! I'm coming!  Maybe we can just drop the special by the lake on the way.
"
24,1,Sharon,"Fuck you!
"
24,1,Stan,"Here we are, Butters! Look! You made it!
"
24,1,Butters,"Oh boy, is this a dream?
"
24,1,Stan,"No, it's not a dream! We are really here, and we are going to build you a bear! Which one you want? You want the panda? You want the Bronco koala?
"
24,1,Butters,"The Caballero Grizzly.
"
24,1,Stan,"Caballero Grizzly.  Okay, we just find the sh-shell and the uh, the outfit.
"
24,1,Cartman,"Stan, you really need employee assistance with this.
"
24,1,Stan,"It's gonna fucking work! Just fucking shut up!  Okay! Okay, Butters. Look!  We're gonna put the stuffing in!
"
24,1,Butters,"Wow!
"
24,1,Stan,"Okay, uh, um... 
"
24,1,Butters,"Aaaah! God! Daaagh!
"
24,1,Stan,"It's okay! We can start over! We can start over! There's do-over machine right over there! Look! 
"
24,1,Sharon,"Stanley! Staaaaan! What if he's dead, Randy?!
"
24,1,Randy,"He's not dead, Sharon.
"
24,1,Sharon,"Then why hasn't he even called?! 
"
24,1,Man 3,"Hey, can we have some of that Pandemic Special?
"
24,1,Randy,"No!  Nobody needs the special right now! It's not helping!  Oh my God. Oh God no.
"
24,1,Sharon,"What?? 
"
24,1,Randy," They got Applebee's too.  Drive me back to the farm, Sharon. I need to get something.
"
24,1,Stan,"God dammit! 
"
24,1,Kyle,"Dude, just let it go.
"
24,1,Stan,"No, Kyle, we can't let Butters down!
"
24,1,Kyle," Stan, are you sure this is about Butters? 'Cause you seem really desperate to build a bear.
"
24,1,Yates," Attention protesting looters.  Protesting slash looting is a violation of the Mayor's health order! You have 5 minutes to come out or we will have to take action
"
24,1,Butters,"We gotta surrender, fellas. I'm honestly not having that much fun anyway.
"
24,1,Stan,"No! I'm not giving up!
"
24,1,Yates,"All right, that was about 5 minutes.  Okay, boys! Light 'em up! 
"
24,1,Randy," Wait! Everyone just stop!
"
24,1,Yates,"Who the hell is that?
"
24,1,Randy,"I have something that might change all of this! 
"
24,1,Stephen,"It's the pangolin.
"
24,1,Thomas,"Look!
"
24,1,Other townsfolk,"The pangolin! He's found it! The pangolin! Whoa!
"
24,1,Randy,"This... is what you've all be looking for, right? Well here! Go ahead and do all the tests you want on it. You'll find out... everything you need to know. 
"
24,1,Cartman,"Oh, no! You're not ending this pandemic! 
"
24,1,Kyle,"Hey!
"
24,1,Stan,"Cartman, no!  Don't do it, Cartman! That thing is our only chance!
"
24,1,Cartman,"Your only chance! For your normal, not mine! I am not going back to school!
"
24,1,Stan,"You guys were right, okay? This hasn't been about Butters. I've been acting like this because I can't take these shutdowns anymore, and I'm scared what it's doing to me! I'm looking for whom to blame. Saying I'm trying to help people to make myself feel better because the truth is... I just wanna have fun again.  I wanted to see that I could go out in the world and do things that I used to do, but I can't. I'm not any better, and I don't care any more than anyone else. And I did all this  because I just want my life back! I just want my life back... 
"
24,1,Kyle," I don't believe it.
"
24,1,Stephen,"So, so what happens now?
"
24,1,Chief Scientist,"Now we have hope. We've learned that we might never get back our old lives, but by working together, we just might find a new way to- 
"
24,1,Mr. Garrison,"Don't forget to get out and vote, everybody! Big election coming up. 
"
24,1,Radio reporter,"And since the students broke quarantine, all South Park residents are now exposed and under complete lockdown for the unforeseeable future. 
"
24,1,Randy,"How do I even begin to apologize? You guys were right. I think all the marijuana really did go to my head. You said it: a drug is a drug, and... I'm not who I used to be. It's time for me to own up to everything. It's time everyone knew what started this pandemic.  Hey, Sharon, I need to talk to you.  I'm not as strong as you are, Sharon. I can't deal with hard times the way that you can. 
"
24,1,Sharon,"If you're ready to talk, I'm ready to listen, Randy.  What?
"
24,1,Randy,"...You want nothing to do with the Pandemic Special.
"
24,1,Sharon,"No. I don't smoke marijuana, Randy.
"
24,1,Randy,"Uh huh. 
"
24,1,Sharon,"Well, what did you want to talk to me about?
"
24,1,Randy,"I just... think maybe I'm gonna do a few more specials. You got some shit on your face. 
"
24,2,Richard Adler,"Oof, I feel silly. They're not gonna let us in!
"
24,2,Mr. Mackey,"Will you just come on. You gotta loosen up, Mr. Adler.
"
24,2,Richard Adler,"But this is the most popular place in town right now!
"
24,2,Mr. Mackey,"We can get in. Just comb your hair, you know, look your best. I can get us in. 
"
24,2,Man with Green Coat,"Come on, man. We've been waiting for hours. You guys have plenty of vaccinations in there, just let us in, man.
"
24,2,Walgreens Bouncer,"55 and older and first responders only. 
"
24,2,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, uh, hey, uh, we'd like to get in there and get some vaccinations, mkay.
"
24,2,Walgreens Bouncer,"Are you on the list?
"
24,2,Mr. Mackey,"Well, no, I'm not on the list. I tried to get on the list. I sat on my computer 30 nights in a row trying to make a vaccination appointment and get on the God damn list. Look, the thing is, we are school faculty, mkay. You gotta let us in.
"
24,2,Stephen Stotch," No, no, you have to let in people with health issues first! I'm a chain smoker and my wife is 39 pounds overweight.
"
24,2,Unnamed Man 1,"I have a compromised immune system! I have genital warts, and I will show them to you.
"
24,2,Walgreens Bouncer," Over 55, first responders and Group 2B only . Now beat it !
"
24,2,Unnamed Man 2,"Hey, hey, man, I'm a friend of Dan Roberts -- he's a dental assistant in conifer...
"
24,2,Walgreens Bouncer,"Get the fuck outta here. I said you're not gettin' in! You're wasting your time!  Oh, hello, ma'am. Right this way. 
"
24,2,Everyone in line,"Awwww!
"
24,2,Elderly Woman," 79, bitchessss!
"
24,2,Everyone in line,"Boo!
"
24,2,Man with Green Coat,"You suck. You suck you stupid old people!
"
24,2,Cartman," Stan, Kyle, can you come over here real quick?
"
24,2,Stan,"Recess is almost over, dude.
"
24,2,Cartman,"Just come here please, it's important.
"
24,2,Cartman,"Hey, Kenny. I got the guys, okay? You wanna talk or you want me to talk?
"
24,2,Kenny,"(You can talk.)
"
24,2,Cartman," You guys, Kenny and I are feeling like, even though things are supposedly getting better with the pandemic, we're more depressed than ever.  The four of us just seem really different towards each other and we're worried the past year has put a strain to our broship. Kenny was saying he wants to do everything he can to save the broship, and I agree with him. So we had a really positive talk about it during lunch, and Kenny shared some ideas of how maybe we can navigate through this, and I think we came up with a great idea. Okay, so, you know how chicks have periods right?
"
24,2,Kyle,"What?
"
24,2,Cartman,"It's true! Women have ""periods"" where they bleed from their vagina. Remember earlier today, Stan, you said our teacher was wearing white? So when we talked I said to Kenny ""Oh, what if the teacher got her period?"" which cheered us up a bit and then we realized today was hamburger day for lunch. There was lots of ketchup laying around. So me and Kenny snuck into the classroom during recess and put it on the teacher's chair, and now when we get back to class there's gonna be a bunch of ketchup  on the teacher's chair and when she stands up it's gonna totally look like she got her period!  It's going to be amazing, you guys. I'm so excited!
"
24,2,Mrs. Nelson,"Okay, class. Hope everyone had a good lunch.  Okay, how did everyone do on their fractions? Are there any questions?  I know the last few were a little tricky. 
"
24,2,Cartman," Shh! Kyle, Kyle! Shhh! 
"
24,2,Bebe,"Mrs. Nelson, I couldn't figure out number 14.
"
24,2,Mrs. Nelson,"Number 14. Okay. Well, let's look at it together. 
"
24,2,Kids,"Ewwwwww! 
"
24,2,Mrs. Nelson,"What?  What? What is -- What is this?
"
24,2,Cartman,"Oh, my God.  Teacher had her period. 
"
24,2,Mrs. Nelson," Kids, something must be wrong with me.   Is this a prank?
"
24,2,Cartman," That's nasty, teacher. Don't have your period during class time!
"
24,2,Mrs. Nelson," Do you think this is funny? I come here, and I risk my life to teach you? And I can't even get a vaccination because teachers aren't important enough?!  And I get on the websites and can't even get a straight answer on when I'll get vaccinated?! Well, I'm over it!  I can't do this anymore! 
"
24,2,Cartman,"You guys, I think that might have been the single most hilarious thing we've ever done.
"
24,2,Cartman,"Which one should we post, you guys? Should we post the one where you can see the most blood on teacher's ass or the one where she makes the dumbest face?
"
24,2,Kyle," You're not posting anything! Do you have any idea what you've done?
"
24,2,Kenny,"(What do you mean, dude?)
"
24,2,Stan,"Yeah, we finally get back to school and have some sense of normalcy and you guys make the teacher walk out!
"
24,2,Cartman,"Hey, at least Kenny and I were doing something to try and get that spark back. You know 30 percent of broships didn't make it through the pandemic?
"
24,2,Kyle,"What if they make us go back to remote learning?! I don't want to go back to being quarantined at home like some of the other kids still are!
"
24,2,Butters," Hey, fellas!  Anything fun happen at school today?!
"
24,2,Cartman,"Yeah, you missed it! It was the best thing ever!  We put ketchup in the teacher's seat and made her think it was her period!
"
24,2,Butters,"Oh, my gosh! That sounds like so much fun!
"
24,2,Cartman,"Yeah, pretty much greatest day of our lives.
"
24,2,Stan," Do you guys know how hard it's going to be for them to find us a replacement teacher?
"
24,2,Cartman,"It's not gonna be hard. They'll bring in some lame ass teacher who's desperate to work. How bad can it be?
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison," Oh... I'm baaack! Hey, South Park! I'm home!
"
24,2,Unnamed Man 3," Holy shit, is that who I think it is?
"
24,2,Bus Driver," Any luggage from below, sir?
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, yes, I've got a lot of baggage!
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison,"Hey! Hey, Valmer! How're you doing?  Tucker! Lookin' good!  Oh it's so great to see everybody  
"
24,2,Thompson," Hey! Fuck you!
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison,"Hey, hey, lookin' good, Thompson! Did your wife get that AIDS test?!
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison,"You know, the simple truth is, teaching is my life.  I'm just completely at home in the classroom.  I realize that now more than ever after my little sabbatical.
"
24,2,PC Principal,"Yes... Your, sabbatical was somewhat controversial.
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison,"Well, I just went through a little thing. You know, I... I realized I was gay. And then I realized I wasn't gay, I was a woman. And after I transitioned, I thought it was a little mistake and then I went through a phase of being the President of the United States.
"
24,2,PC Principal,"Well, that is the problem, Mr. Garrison, as someone who previously identified as President, there could be safety issues.
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, that's not a problem. Anyone who has been President is assigned secret service for the rest of their lives to keep them protected.  Mr. Service!  This is my private security, Mr. Service.
"
24,2,Mr. Service,"Hello.
"
24,2,PC Principal,"Uh, thank you for your application, Mr. Garrison. We'll keep you in mind as a backup, but hopefully the vaccination process is going to start opening up.
"
24,2,Man with Green Coat,"Come on, man, it's ridiculous that people can't get in.
"
24,2,Man with Burgundy Coat,"Yeah, you know, in Israel they vaccinate everybody. Israel's way cooler than this lame place!
"
24,2,Walgreens Bouncer,"So then go to Israel.
"
24,2,Man with Burgundy Coat,"I tried... I couldn't get in. 
"
24,2,Chris,"Tom, I'm outside of the hottest place in town, and what we'd like to do now is take you  for an exclusive look inside.
"
24,2,Walgreens Bouncer,"You're not getting in, pal
"
24,2,Chris," I'm actually willing to go inside and get a shot so that everyone can see just how safe it is.
"
24,2,Walgreens Bouncer,"I said get lost, you're not getting in.  Get outta my face.
"
24,2,Chris,"Please give me a shot.  Please, all I want is a shot.  Just that one shot that could change everything.
"
24,2,Walgreens Bouncer," Everyone clear outta the way. Clear the entrance. We have VIPs coming out. 
"
24,2,Elderly People,"Whoo-hoo!
"
24,2,Elderly Man 1,"Where to next, everybody?
"
24,2,Elderly Man 2,"That was our second shot. Let's go out to the bars!
"
24,2,Elderly People,"Yeah!
"
24,2,Stephen Stotch," Old people suck!
"
24,2,Elderly Man 3,"Hah? Can't hear ya. Got too many antibodies in my ears!
"
24,2,Elderly People,"Hahahaha!
"
24,2,Marvin,"Hey there, Billy! Still gotta wear that mask, huh? We're all vaccinated now. I'm gonna go out to the bars and get some pussy!
"
24,2,Stan,"Okay, grandpa.
"
24,2,Elderly Men,"Yeahhhh!
"
24,2,Marvin's Friend 1,"Sayyy... When are they gonna vaccinate you kids? Oh, yeah! You're last! 
"
24,2,Marvin,"Have fun social distancing, loser! 
"
24,2,Cartman,"Hey, broships. You ready for some substitute teacher action? This should be fun!
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison," Hey, kids! Guess who's baaaaaaaaack?
"
24,2,Everyone," Awwwwww! Yuck!
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison,"Well, I know you've all had a lot of time off this past year.
"
24,2,Cartman,"Oh, dear Christ, what have we done?
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison,"But it's time to get you all back on track. Now, I expect discipline and respect in this classroom -- both to me and your new teacher's assistant, Mr. Service.  Hand these papers out, Mr. Service. 
"
24,2,Lola,"Nice going, you dumb cocks!
"
24,2,Red,"Stupid assholes!
"
24,2,Scott,"You guys are dicks.
"
24,2,Cartman,"Wow, people are really pissed at us for doing the period joke, you guys.
"
24,2,Kyle,"Why do people think we all did the period joke?
"
24,2,Cartman,"Well, because I told them we all did. People know we're bros and that we do everything together!
"
24,2,Kyle,"You guys are gonna go and tell everyone the truth about who's fault this is! I didn't do anything!
"
24,2,Cartman,"That's right, Kyle, you did nothing. You knew about the prank, you could have stopped it at any time, but you didn't say a word. Silence is violence, Kyle.
"
24,2,Kyle,"What?! Dude!  Are you just gonna stand there and listen to this crap?!
"
24,2,Stan,"I don't even know what to do! If you ask me, this whole pandemic has been a giant waste of time! 
"
24,2,Cartman,"Oh, my God... Maybe our broship didn't survive.
"
24,2,Kyle,"Will you shut up about that!? Nobody cares about your stupid broship! 
"
24,2,Cartman," And now you've made Kenny cry. 
"
24,2,Walgreens Bouncer," Nope... Nope...  I don't see you anywhere on the list.
"
24,2,Gnome 1,"It's ""Gnomes"", ""Underpants Gnomes"".
"
24,2,Gnome 2,"We are essential workers!
"
24,2,Dr. Alphonse Mephesto," Yeah, yeah. Get in line with the rest of us!
"
24,2,Walgreens Bouncer,"Is anybody here actually on the list?! 
"
24,2,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, yes it's uh, Tom, Fireman Tom, mkay.
"
24,2,Walgreens Bouncer,"Will you fucking get lost, pal?
"
24,2,Mr. Mackey,"I don't know what you're talking about!
"
24,2,Walgreens Bouncer,"Alright, that's it.
"
24,2,Mr. Mackey,"I'm a hero of the community.  I'm Fireman Tom!
"
24,2,Elderly People,"Yeehhhh! Partyyy!
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, let's see... Scissors, paper, glue. Ah! Some good old fashioned number 2 pencils. That's what my students need. Mr. Service, can you grab a couple boxes of those pencils over there? 
"
24,2,Unnamed Shopper,"Would you look at that? He ruined our entire country and now he's just back like nothing happened.
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, I think that's all the school supplies we need. Let's grab some healthy snacks for the class snack basket.  Oh. Oh, I see. Look, everyone, there's a gay man shopping! I happen to be the only teacher brave enough to teach your kids right now, so you better all get real woke real fast! Come on, Mr. Service! 
"
24,2,Bob White,"Uh, hey! Excuse me?!  Hey, uh, I'm not sure if you remember me. Bob White? I just want you to know I was always on your side. In fact, all of us Whites were really on your side.
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison,"Look, I'm just a teacher. Okay? Just a teacher, I'm shopping for my class.
"
24,2,Bob White," So, look, uh, what are we supposed to do now? You know, I'm a follower of QAnon. What are we supposed to do to stop the vaccinations? They're vaccinating people right now, seeding people with their microchips! Surely, you have a plan?! We're on the internet every night waiting for word.
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison,"The word is get a fucking life, jackass! Blow shit out your dickhole! 
"
24,2,Bob White,"Did you hear that, honey? He said 'shit... out your dickhole'... He's trying to give us some kind of signal.
"
24,2,Mr. Mackey,"Think my life doesn't matter!? I show you what matters.  Counselors matter. That's what matters. Let's just see how your God damn school functions without a God damn counselor!  Oh, God dammit.  Hey! Hey, you damn old people!  Stop doing donuts in the school parking lot!
"
24,2,Elderly Man on Motorcycle,"Hah?
"
24,2,Mr. Mackey,"I said you old people need to --  Fucking old people rubbing everyone's noses in their fun times!  What?! 
"
24,2,Kenny," (I've been having a lot of problems with my friends. It just seems like the pandemic exposed problems we didn't even know were there. To be honest, I'm not sure that I even see a future with these guys.)
"
24,2,Mr. Mackey,"What?! 
"
24,2,Cartman,"Hey, Kenny. Guys? Guys, come on. You agreed to counseling.  Hey, Mr. Mackey. We, uh, we've been having a lot of problems and um, we all want to work on our broship, don't we guys?
"
24,2,Stan,"Yes.
"
24,2,Kyle,"Yes.
"
24,2,Cartman,"You know this pandemic has been a pressure cooker, and we just feel like we're going through the brotions. You know?
"
24,2,Kyle," Because you guys pulled a prank and made the teacher leave, and now everybody hates us.
"
24,2,Cartman,"Silence is violence, Kyle. Silence is violence.
"
24,2,Mr. Mackey,"Guess what, boys? I don't care. I come here and I listen to you kids bitch about your stupid problems everyday and I'm 50 years old!  I could die tomorrow from this Covid shit!
"
24,2,Stan,"Please, Mr. Mackey, we just want to get our old teacher back for everybody, okay? Can you just tell her we're really, really sorry?
"
24,2,Mr. Mackey,"It's not that simple. There's only one way you're getting your teacher back, and that's if teachers get their hands on the vaccine. 
"
24,2,Cartman,"How do we do that? 
"
24,2,Mr. Mackey,"There's a place in town... Very hard to get into. Very exclusive. Walgreens. I've tried to get in many times... Dressed like a fireman, mkay. Dressed like a little ol' lady, but they got security up the ass.  You find a way inside, get all the vaccines you can and bring them here to the school. You do that, and you just might get your teacher back. Mkay. 
"
24,2,Bob White,"My friends, these are very dangerous times. Our country's future is at a precipice. And that is why I have called together every QAnon follower in our town.
"
24,2,QAnon Follower 1,"Let's forget it, Bob. The bad guys won.
"
24,2,QAnon Follower 2,"I feel like someone pooped on my life.
"
24,2,Bob White,"They didn't win! We just recently received a new coded message.
"
24,2,Female QAnon Tutor,"You got a message from Q?
"
24,2,Bob White,"Not from Q... From the chosen one.  Yes, we saw him. In the produce section of the grocery store. And he said to me... ""Blow shit out your dickhole."" I immediately knew something was amiss, because one can't move feces through their penile urinary tract! So I've been going over it and over it and I realized  Blow shit out dick hole - BSDH. We all know what BS is, but DH? It didn't make sense. Until my wife reminded me that DH are the initials of David Harris, the anon from Akron, Ohio who said that the elite use Latin to send coded messages. Out your dick hole -- Anno Yanis Domini Homme. Do what he does. The chosen is teaching now. He's taking Q's message straight to the children. And he wants us to do the same.
"
24,2,QAnon Follower 1,"We're supposed to be teachers?
"
24,2,Bob White,"There's an incredible shortage of teachers right now. He's trying to tell us that this is our time to strike! The elite want to fuck with our kids? We'll fuck theirs! 
"
24,2,Stan,"Hello, sir!
"
24,2,Walgreens Bouncer,"Who are you?
"
24,2,Cartman,"Oh, hey, hi. We're with the nonprofit service Kids for Kommunity. Both spelled with a K.
"
24,2,Stan,"Yeah, we assist senior citizens who need the vaccine, but then need help getting to the right place.
"
24,2,Walgreens Bouncer,"Oh, really? That's pretty damn awesome you guys. I wish more people could be like the Kommunity Kidz. Go on in. 
"
24,2,Everyone in line,"Awwww! Come on!
"
24,2,Man with Green Coat,"Hey, I'm in Kommunity Kidz, too! 
"
24,2,Stan,"Holy shit, dude. That was pretty easy!
"
24,2,Cartman,"Yeah bros! Kommunity Kidz spelled with a K. Gets 'em every time.
"
24,2,Elderly Woman in Wheelchair,"Alright, so where's my Goddamn money?
"
24,2,Kyle,"What?!
"
24,2,Elderly Woman in Wheelchair,"I told you I already got the vaccine. I'm doin' this for the cash!
"
24,2,Kyle,"Yeah, but we already paid you.
"
24,2,Elderly Woman in Wheelchair,"Oh, I must have Alzheimer's, I'm just an olllld lady.  Pay again or I squeal.
"
24,2,Cartman,"You God damn old bitch!
"
24,2,Stan,"Just pay her, Cartman.
"
24,2,Cartman,"What?!
"
24,2,Stan,"Come on, the pharmacist is coming!
"
24,2,Cartman,"This is becoming the most expensive period joke we ever did! 
"
24,2,Walgreens Pharmacist,"Excuse me, what are you children doing in here?
"
24,2,Kyle,"We're Kommunity Kidz. We help seniors get vaccinated.
"
24,2,Walgreens Pharmacist,"Oh, well that's very great. These boys are helping you, ma'am?
"
24,2,Elderly Woman in Wheelchair,"Oh, actually I'm not sure. I have a little Alzheimer's. Might need a little more greenback to jar my memory.
"
24,2,Cartman,"Oh, you fucking slut! This is why we keep old people in the back of the line!
"
24,2,Kyle,"Cartman, just stick to the fucking plan!
"
24,2,Stan,"Oh, great, Kyle. Now he knows there's a plan!
"
24,2,Walgreens Pharmacist,"What plan?!
"
24,2,Elderly Woman in Wheelchair,"They're lying about Kommunity Kidz!
"
24,2,Walgreens Pharmacist,"It's community with a C like normal?!
"
24,2,Stan,"Kenny, grab the vaccines! 
"
24,2,Kyle,"RUN!!
"
24,2,Stan,"Go, go, go, go!!
"
24,2,Man with Green Coat,"Hey...
"
24,2,Unnamed Man 4," Kommunity Kidz have vaccines!
"
24,2,Clark,"For the last time, Ellen, I don't want our son going to that public school! Mr. Garrison is a terrible teacher, he has no grip on the classroom and he's the worst president we've ever had!
"
24,2,Ellen,"But Scott has to go to school, dear.
"
24,2,Clark,"So we can get him a private tutor!
"
24,2,Ellen,"We can't afford a private tutor, you know that. 
"
24,2,Richard,"Hey, guys, what's the problem? 
"
24,2,Clark,"It's that son of a bitch Mr.Garrison. He's gonna completely screw up our kids.
"
24,2,Richard,"Well, that's why we pulled Tweek out of school. Haven't you heard? There's a brand new private tutoring company that's fast and affordable!
"
24,2,Advertiser,"Has your child fallen behind in school?  Do you feel like the government has failed you and your child during the time of Covid? 
"
24,2,Tutornon Member 1,"Then call us! The tutors at Tutornon! 
"
24,2,Female QAnon Tutor,"Forget the classroom! Tutornon is bespoke learning that is straight from the internet  to your child. '
"
24,2,Tutornon Member 1,"We sift through all the information on the internet and present it to your child for a uniquely curated experience. 
"
24,2,Bob White,"Forget all the Zooms and masks and social distancing at school.  Let Tutornon save your child. Literally!
"
24,2,Advertiser,"Contact Tutornon today! On Facebook, YouTube and Twitter!
"
24,2,Clark,"Alright, Scott. Your new tutor is here. 
"
24,2,Jake Angeli,"Hey, there! Ready to get back on track with your schoolwork?
"
24,2,Scott,"I guess so.
"
24,2,Clark,"You better pay attention and listen to everything he has to teach you!
"
24,2,Jake Angeli,"We'll be great, thanks!  Alright, sit down. We don't have much time!
"
24,2,Scott,"Huh?
"
24,2,Jake Angeli,"Tom Hanks and Oprah are just two at the very top of an elite group of people who control everything we see and do. They feed upon children in order to maintain their elite status, and that isn't the worst of it. Do you know what pedophilia is? Here, let me show you.
"
24,2,Scott," Daaad?!
"
24,2,Chris,"Tom, I'm standing outside the ultra-exclusive Walgreens where earlier today vaccines were taken by that group of young Robin Hoods, the Kommunity Kidz. These brave kids have taken it into their own hands to get people a shot. That's all people want, just a shot, and these boys have made it so you just might get that shot. And have a chance at hope and some happiness in this  -- in this shit world -- 
"
24,2,Tom,"Okay, thank you, Chris. We'll get back -- 
"
24,2,Chris," No! No! Fuck you, Tom, because Kommunity Kidz are just what this town and this world needed! And it's amazing that some kids took some God damn time to actually go out and do something. Fuck you, Tom. 
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison,"Alright, children, let's take our seats.  Today is standardized testing.  We're gonna make sure you lazy ducks have still been studying through this whole pandemic.
"
24,2,Mr. Service,"Sir?
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison,"Yes, Mr. Service?  Where the hell is everybody?  I said, where are my students?! Bebe!  You always know where Wendy is! Where is she?!
"
24,2,Bebe,"I think... her parents pulled her out school and get her a private tutor.
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison," A private tutor?! Why would they get a private tutor?!
"
24,2,Bebe,"Umm..., I'm pretty sure it's because her parents hate you?
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison,"What makes you think that?!
"
24,2,Bebe,"Because I was talking to them about it... Because... I hate you too.
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison,"I am trying to get things back to normal around here!  Why is everyone acting like this?! Why is everyone against me?!
"
24,2,Mr. Service,"I don't know, sir.
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison,"I'm gonna get to the bottom of this! Come on, Mr. Service! 
"
24,2,Mrs. Nelson,"Hello?
"
24,2,Cartman," Hi, Mrs. Nelson, it's Eric Cartman.
"
24,2,Mrs. Nelson," What do you want?
"
24,2,Cartman,"Mrs. Nelson, we would like for you to come back to school tomorrow, because... we have COVID-19 vaccinations.
"
24,2,Mrs. Nelson,"Really? You think I'm gonna let you prank me again? I heard you were the ones responsible for the period prank!
"
24,2,Cartman,"And it was so uncalled for and so wrong. I mean, especially because we're guys. I mean, dudes sitting around coming up with period jokes, like, how old are we? Seriously?
"
24,2,Mrs. Nelson,"Yeah, I don't trust you. I'll just wait until the government decides teachers are important enough to get their vaccinations.
"
24,2,Cartman,"You are so important. Which is why it was so not funny what we did. I mean, what is funny about blood coming out of a woman's vagina? Like, it's sexist, first of all, and you know what else? It's just lazy. Just like dialing it in, that's what we were doing. We were just dialing it in.
"
24,2,Mrs. Nelson,"You better be at school tomorrow morning, and you better really have vaccinations. For all the teachers!
"
24,2,Cartman,"Hey, we will be there. Period.  Okay. Okay, cool. Bye.  Did you guys hear what I said?
"
24,2,Kyle," Why did you almost blow it at the very end, you idiot?!
"
24,2,Cartman,"Relax, guys. She's gonna come.
"
24,2,Kyle," Will you please say something to him?!
"
24,2,Stan," What the hell did I do?!
"
24,2,Kenny," (You guys stop it! Stop it!) 
"
24,2,Man with Burgundy Coat,"
This is my moment
This is my tiiiiimmmmeeee...


Hello?

"
24,2,Man with Burgundy Coat,"
I've got a dream to fulfill
And all I need is a shot!
Please
Please just gimme a shot!


"
24,2,Man with Green Coat,"Listen, Kommunity Kidz!

All I want is a shot!
A-and you can give me that shot!
That one shot, that's all I need!


"
24,2,Need a Shot Woman Singer,"
All I want is a shot, too!
If I had a shot, I would make the most of it!


"
24,2,Crowd,"Gimme a shot! Please I need a shot!
"
24,2,Guitar Singer,"
If I just had a shot
I would make it the best shot


"
24,2,Cartman,"Wow, everyone just really wants a shot. 
"
24,2,Stephen,"Kommunity Kidz, please! If you just give me a shot, why I could be somebody! I could go out to fancy restaurants like all them old people. And eat shrimp as big as my head!
"
24,2,Man with Green Coat," You're not taking my shot. This is my shot!
"
24,2,Man with Burgundy Coat,"I, I have to have this shot! 
"
24,2,Kyle," Grab the vaccines. I think we better get outta here. 
"
24,2,Female QAnon Tutor,"This is a fact. We are all being controlled by an elite, wealthy, and privileged few.  When Jeffrey Epstein the billionaire was found guilty of sex trafficking, he was set to squeal on all the elites in Hollywood and in Washington who used his child sex services...  But Epstein was found dead in his cell from ""suicide"". Why do the elites want children from sex traffickers? Adrenochrome.  It is harvested from children for a euphoric and life-enhancing benefit.  This Satanic cabal of Hollywood and political elites all need the adrenochrome to maintain their positions of power.  And they will continue to do so until we stand up against them.  Now, do you have any questions, Craig?
"
24,2,Craig,"Um... so does Oprah drink the same blood as Obama, or is it usually a different kid?
"
24,2,Female QAnon Tutor,"It's kids from all over the world. Now... it's time for me to tell you the biggest thing that the Hollywood elites don't want you to know -- 
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison,"Alright, just what the hell do you think you're doing?!
"
24,2,Female QAnon Tutor," Oh! 
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison,"Go tutor someone else! You think you can take my students from my classroom?!
"
24,2,Female QAnon Tutor," Oh, my God! It's you! 
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison,"That's right, it's me! The head teacher at South Park Elementary! And this is what I think of private tutors! Get her, Mr. Service!  Now who's in charge of all you tutors?!
"
24,2,Female QAnon Tutor," It's... it's secret...
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison,"Choke her out, Mr. Service!
"
24,2,Female QAnon Tutor,"No! Please!
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison,"Who started this bogus tutoring company?!
"
24,2,Female QAnon Tutor," It was... it...
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison,"I'm listening!
"
24,2,Female QAnon Tutor,"It was... the Whitessss. 
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison,"The Whites? That guy was harassing me at the grocery store! Come on, Mr. Service. It's time to deal with the Whites. 
"
24,2,Craig," I guess 2021 is gonna be just like 2020.
"
24,2,Kyle,"All good?
"
24,2,Stan," I don't see anybody. I think we're safe here until school starts in the morning.
"
24,2,Kenny,"(We're actually gonna sleep here?)
"
24,2,Kyle,"I don't see what choice we have.
"
24,2,Cartman," Oh, my God.
"
24,2,Stan," What?
"
24,2,Cartman," You guys, oh my God, seriously.
"
24,2,Kyle," What?
"
24,2,Cartman," You guys know Mr. Lawson? Jenny Lawson's dad?
"
24,2,Kenny,"(Yeah?)
"
24,2,Cartman," He's offering us 2,000 bucks for a vaccination.
"
24,2,Kyle," What are you doing?
"
24,2,Cartman,"Dude, people really want their shot. I'm asking around to see what they're willing to pay for it. I'm a little Harvey Weinstein.
"
24,2,Kyle," We are giving these to the teachers at the school!
"
24,2,Cartman,"Kyle, this is what our broship needs! We can sell these and go on vacations together, go to shows and theme parks!
"
24,2,Kyle," What the broship needs is for us to do the right thing and fix the problem of everyone hating us!  Right, Stan?
"
24,2,Stan,"I say we take the vaccines ourselves. I mean, why are us kids last? This whole pandemic has been about doing what's best for adults. Maybe for the broship we do what's best for us.
"
24,2,Cartman,"What's best for us is thousands of dollars. That's always what's best!
"
24,2,Kyle," You guys are being selfish! You're not thinking about what's best for the broship. You're thinking about what's best for you. We did all this because we wanted to fix the damage of the period prank. That means taking these to the school tomorrow morning for our teachers.  I'm gonna put these somewhere safe so no one gets tempted to do the wrong thing!
"
24,2,Cartman," I don't know why you don't stand up to him more, it's really disappointing.
"
24,2,Kyle," Oh, crap.  Hey, dad. Look, I'm okay. I won't be home until tomorrow 'cause... well, I'm doing something really important.
"
24,2,Gerald," Oh, okay, Kyle. Sounds good! Thanks, buddy!
"
24,2,Kyle," You're not... worried?
"
24,2,Gerald,"Hey, we trust you, Kyle!  Say, Kyle, we heard you have some COVID-19 vaccinations.
"
24,2,Kyle," They're for our teachers.
"
24,2,Gerald,"Oh, okay. Yeah, that makes sense. You know, if you think your teacher is worth saving more than us...
"
24,2,Kyle,"It's not like that.
"
24,2,Gerald,"Well, it sounds like that! Sounds like your teacher's life is more important than your mom and dad's!  You know, when all this went down, the school wasn't really there for you, was it?  School kind of abandoned you kids. But your parents, well... we didn't shove you off into a Zoom meeting, did we?
"
24,2,Kyle,"Dad, please don't-
"
24,2,Gerald,"You know, we're not spring chickens anymore.  The virus is still out there, Kyle, and it's still killing people. I don't know how you'd feel if mom or me got COVID and died in these last few months because you did nothing. Don't do nothing, Kyle. You know what, Kyle?
"
24,2,Kyle," Please don't say it.
"
24,2,Gerald,"Silence is violence, Kyle. Don't kill mom, buddy. 
"
24,2,Kyle," Shit.
"
24,2,Bob,"Go get that will you, Crystal? 
"
24,2,Bob,"Who is it, sweetheart?
"
24,2,Crystal,"It's the savior of our country and still president of the United States who was impeached unjustly.
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison," Get them, Mr. Service!
"
24,2,Crystal," Aah!
"
24,2,Bob," What's this all about? Did we do something wrong?
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison," God damn right you did something wrong! Our public school system is dying and you tutors are trying to take advantage of it!
"
24,2,Bob,"But we were just trying to be like you!
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison,"You'll never be like me! I've been a teacher for 30 years! I'm just trying to get my old life back and assholes keep getting in my way!
"
24,2,Bob,"But we have to tell children the truth! They have to know!
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison,"They have to know what!?
"
24,2,Bob,"About-- about the whole thing! About the vaccinations! That the pandemic was blown out of proportion!
"
24,2,Crystal,"That Venezuelan socialists switched out circuit boards from voting machines in 12 states!
"
24,2,Bob,"Good, sweetie!  Don't you understand everything is being manipulated!
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison," Everyone's being manipulated... So that's why everyone in town is being such an inconsiderate jerk about me coming back?
"
24,2,Bob,"Yes. They don't want people to like you. They need people to hate you!
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison,"Who are they?
"
24,2,Bob,"They're the elites. They do whatever they want and they feed on the pain and torture of children! And if anybody starts to care, they'll just cut us off when we tell the truth! And the truth is that -- 
"
24,2,Stan,"Kyle?  What are you doing?
"
24,2,Kyle," I'm just getting things ready to go.
"
24,2,Stan," So then why are you replacing some of the vaccines with Cactus Cooler?
"
24,2,Kyle,"Alright, Stan, look. It's just the pressure of everything, okay!? My dad called and... I don't want my mom to die.
"
24,2,Stan," I don't want my mom to die either! I can't believe that you would lie to me. That you would hide shit from me.
"
24,2,Kenny," (Hey, guys, what's going on?)
"
24,2,Kyle," Nothing, Kenny. Everything's fine.
"
24,2,Stan," Yeah, we're gonna go to the school now, buddy.
"
24,2,Kenny,"(Okay.) 
"
24,2,Stan," I'm just gonna try and pretend this didn't happen. But only because it's what's best for Kenny. 
"
24,2,Cartman,"I can't believe we're actually doing this. There are people out there who really need these vaccines -- who have cash.
"
24,2,Stan,"I just want this over with. Let's get these stupid things to the teachers and go home.
"
24,2,Scott,"I don't think so, Kommunity Kidz! You're not poisoning anybody with those vaccinations!
"
24,2,Cartman,"The fuck are you talking about, Scott?
"
24,2,Scott,"I've learned the truth! And I won't let you hurt the teacher!
"
24,2,Stan,"We don't have time for this, Scott. 
"
24,2,Scott,"You don't understand! I'm part of a militant group now! A secret cabal of patriot children!  Lil' Qties!
"
24,2,Cartman,"Lil' Qties? With a ""Q"" and an apostrophe after the ""L""? That's way better than Kommunity Kids, guys. I told you, we're getting lazy.
"
24,2,Scott," Move in on my position, Qties!
"
24,2,Clyde,"You're not hurting our teacher again!
"
24,2,Lil' Qties Blonde Girl,"You don't even know what those vaccines are doing to people!
"
24,2,Scott,"For the past year, our feelings and our needs have been put dead last! Do you guys really trust anybody anymore?
"
24,2,Butters,"Yeah!
"
24,2,Kyle,"Butters?  You're a part of this too?
"
24,2,Butters,"I just wanted to believe in something that would get me out of the house! I didn't give a shit what it was.
"
24,2,Scott,"Now just put down the vaccines and walk away, Kommunity Kidz.
"
24,2,Cartman,"Look, you guys have a right to say and believe whatever you want, okay? But what you believe is really stupid.
"
24,2,Scott,"We'll see who's stupid! 
"
24,2,Chris,"Tom, I'm standing outside South Park Elementary, where the Kommunity Kidz were set to distribute vaccines to the public. That's when a rival gang showed up and tried to stop them, and the fighting is still going on now.  You can see behind me most of the damage is done, but it is still raging on, Tom. You can see this awful gang is trying to stop the Kommunity Kidz, just because the Kommunity Kidz believe in something and actually -- and actually care! They care enough to do something!
"
24,2,Tom,"Yeah, that's basically what the Lil' Qties are doing too, right, Chris?
"
24,2,Chris,"What do you mean, Tom?
"
24,2,Tom,"Well, the Kommunity Kidz are acting on something they believe in and so are the Lil' Qties, am I right? What is the difference?
"
24,2,Chris,"Oh, yeah, well, the difference, Tom, is that you're a giant piece of shit. That's the fucking difference!
"
24,2,Tom,"Okay, let's just --
"
24,2,Chris,"You're gonna even remotely defend these monsters when Kommunity Kidz are promoting change, just -- Fuck you, Tom! I'm out! 
"
24,2,Kyle,"Oh no! Oh, Jesus, look! 
"
24,2,Unnamed Man 5,"This is my shot!
"
24,2,Unnamed Man 6,"My shot!
"
24,2,Stan," We got to get outta here!
"
24,2,Bob," Come on! I can show you my Q headquarters!
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison," Jesus, you people really take this seriously.
"
24,2,Bob,"Vaccinations are nothing more than a way for the elite and powerful to control us.  We've been trying to warn everyone, and then Q released a new post saying the most important day woud be March 4th. At first it didn't make sense. Nothing's happening on March 4th! Until I saw a Super Bowl ad for a new streaming service which launched on March 4th! Streaming is also the term used for nano-technology microchips invented by Bill Gates that are being put into a liquid and then shot into people's arms as a vaccine!
"
24,2,Mr.Garrison,"Who the hell is doing all this?
"
24,2,Bob,"The Hollywood elites!  All of them, rich, powerful people who got to where they were by drinking adrenochrome from tortured children! Anyone who gets vaccinated is going to be tracked and manipulated for the rest of their lives.
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison,"I got an e-mail that all teachers are about to be vaccinated at the school! You're telling me they're all going to become mindless zombies who are fine with child murder?
"
24,2,Bob,"Yes!
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison,"Aw geez, we gotta get to the school! 
"
24,2,Bob,"I'll let all the other 'anons know!  We'll put a stop to this once and for all!  Let's do this!
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison,"Hey! What the hell just happened?
"
24,2,Bob,"It's the Hollywood elites! They're on to us! Come on! 
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison," Oh, my holy Jesus!
"
24,2,Bob," Don't want the truth coming out, huh? Damn you! We'll get to the school! You can't stop us!
"
24,2,Mrs. Nelson,"I'm sorry for wasting everyone's time. I don't know why I believed them when they said they had vaccinations.  I don't know why I believe anything anymore.  Yes?
"
24,2,Cartman,"Hi, Mrs. Nelson! How are you?
"
24,2,Mrs. Nelson,"Cut the crap! You said you'd be here at 7:00 AM!
"
24,2,Cartman,"And, you know, we just ran into a little hiccup, so we wanted to see if you could meet us somewhere else for the vaccine.
"
24,2,Mrs. Nelson," Oh, no. I knew this was a prank. You're not tricking me into going anywhere!
"
24,2,Cartman,"No, no, Mrs. Nelson, it's not a prank! Okay, fine, we'll be there, okay? Just sit tight. 
"
24,2,Kyle," What was that!? You know we can't get into the school!
"
24,2,Cartman,"She's not gonna come meet us, Kyle!
"
24,2,Kyle,"You didn't even try! . He didn't try because he wants to sell the vaccines for money!
"
24,2,Stan," And what about you, Kyle? You were the one trying to take vaccines for yourself this morning!
"
24,2,Cartman,"He what?!
"
24,2,Kyle,"Wow. Okay. I thought we had gotten past that, but --
"
24,2,Stan,"Look, let's just face it, you guys. We don't trust each other and we don't like each other. We can't keep pretending.
"
24,2,Kyle,"Are you seriously saying what I think?
"
24,2,Cartman,"Alright, guys. I guess it's time we all had the talk we never wanted to have.  Kenny, you wanna go get on your iPad for a minute?
"
24,2,Kenny,"(What? No, I wanna hear this!)
"
24,2,Cartman,"We just -- we really need to talk for a second, Kenny. Look, I downloaded Madagascar 3. You wanna watch with your Troll headphones? 
"
24,2,Kenny,"(Yeah, okay.) 
"
24,2,Stan,"Look, it's been a hard year. And I think for some people there's just no going back.
"
24,2,Cartman,"I've been trying as hard as I can to hold things together, but I have to admit... I'm just going through the ""brotions.""
"
24,2,Stan,"We can't just force things for Kenny's sake. It's not good for us and it's not good for him. 
"
24,2,Kyle," We still have a bunch of vaccines here. What happens now?
"
24,2,Cartman,"I think I have a plan.
"
24,2,Tom,"And explosive powder keg of humanity is set to go off at South Park Elementary!  Thousands of people have turned up to get their shot -- that one shot that could change everything. But also in the crowd are several people who want to stop those vaccines from happening. At the center of it all -- that amazing group of kids who are just taking the time for what they believe is right. I'm talking, of course, about the Lil' Qties. A group of youngsters that believe vaccines are harmful --
"
24,2,Chris," Yeah -- yeah, I see what you did there, Tom. That's real fucking cute.
"
24,2,Tom,"I'm not trying to be cute. I'm saying if these kids really believe the horrific things they believe, then they'd be bad people not to go out and do something about it, wouldn't they?
"
24,2,Chris," Yes, that's totally true if you're a corrupt dickhead without morals. You gotta be fucking --
"
24,2,Tom,"Okay, okay, Chris, let's just get back to the weather.
"
24,2,Chris,"Yeah, let's get back to the weather, you cunt.
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison," Come on, Mr. Service, we have to get back to the school!
"
24,2,Mr. Service," My... My balls are freezing, sir.
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison," Mr. Service's balls are freezing!
"
24,2,Bob," Don't give in to them! They're trying to make a joke of everything! That's what they do!
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison,"How do the elites control Mr. Service's balls?
"
24,2,Bob,"You still don't get it, do you?! They don't just drink adrenochrome, they run the show! The whole damn show!  It come down to two people --  Oh, you don't like that, do you?! That's getting a little close to home, huh?! You can't control me anymore, you sons of bitches!  They're making fun of me to try and discredit my beliefs!  Oh, you don't like that, do you!? Don't want the world to know that!
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison," Listen! Listen, whoever you are! I don't give a shit what you do!
"
24,2,Bob,"What?! What are you saying?!
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison,"Please! I just want my old life back!
"
24,2,Bob,"No, stop! They're monsters!
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison,"I don't care what you do to kids, I just want people to like me again!
"
24,2,Bob,"You son of a bitch! Aah! 
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison,"Aah! Mr. Service!
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison," Ah, oh, okay, what the hell is this? Hey, come back!
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison,"How would you like to make a deal?
"
24,2,Mr. Service," Aah! Aah! 
"
24,2,Cartman,"Alright, here's the situation --  All of our teachers are inside the school, surrounded now by at least 400 to 500 people who want a shot.  The Lil' Qties are stationed throughout and we...  And we are no longer bros. The magic is gone and we are through, is that right? 
"
24,2,Stan,"Yup.
"
24,2,Kyle,"Uh huh.
"
24,2,Cartman,"But we all want what's best for Kenny, so we have to find a way to compromise and move on with our lives. So how do we do it? We use... a 2-2-3.  Kyle, you have Kenny for two days starting on Monday. I have Kenny Thursday and Friday, and then, Stan, you get him for the weekend. Then we switch where I have Kenny starting Monday, Stan gets two days and Kyle gets a weekend.
"
24,2,Kyle,"Do we really have to do this? That- that all seems overly confusing.
"
24,2,Cartman,"Okay, so we can go alternating weeks --  Each one of us has Kenny for six days and then we rotate.
"
24,2,Stan,"A week is a long time for Kenny to be with one person.
"
24,2,Cartman," Alternating weeks with a midweek visit. We have longer stretches, but a change for a break.
"
24,2,Kyle,"Aw, come on. What about sleepovers? We can't take those away from Kenny.
"
24,2,Cartman," Alternating weeks with midweek overnight.
"
24,2,Stan,"It would be easier if I just knew I always had Kenny on certain days.
"
24,2,Cartman," 3-3-4-4 rotation. Makes everyone's days consistent -- oh, hang on on a second, guys.  Everything okay, buddy?
"
24,2,Kenny," (Yeah, what's going on?)
"
24,2,Cartman,"We're almost done in here, Kenny. You liking that birthday cake-flavored ice cream?
"
24,2,Kenny,"(Yeah, it's fine, but I --)
"
24,2,Cartman," Okay, you're doing great, pal.  The 3-3-4-4 is the most consistent, but to change weekends, we would need...  the 2-2-5-5 rotation, where the weekends can actually fluctuate.
"
24,2,Kyle,"I don't even know what to say...
"
24,2,Stan,"Well, I say that out of all of those... the first one makes the most sense.
"
24,2,Cartman," The 2-2-3, I agree. This way we don't have to be bros but Kenny still has the best possible life.
"
24,2,Stan," 2-2-3. That's so ridiculous... that it just might work.
"
24,2,Chris,"We've just received devastating news here at South Park Elementary. It appears that the Kommunity Kidz... are breaking up. They have asked for people to...  ""Respect their privacy in these difficult times,"" and it appears that the strain of this pandemic, from people like you, Tom, was just too much.
"
24,2,Tom," Oh, here we go, here we go.
"
24,2,Chris,"Yeah, here we go!You just couldn't leave 'em alone, could you, ya prick?!
"
24,2,Tom,"Okay, let's just --
"
24,2,Chris,"They broke up 'cause of you and your stupid -- wait. Wait, wait, wait. Wait a minute, what is this?  Tom, one of the Kommunity Kidz has shown up to the school... with the vaccines!
"
24,2,Guitar Singer,"Finally, I'm gonna get my shot! 
"
24,2,Scott," Alright, Qties, this is it! Prepare for the storm! 
"
24,2,Stan," Dude, what are you doing? You're gonna get yourself killed.
"
24,2,Cartman," This isn't our fight anymore, Kyle.
"
24,2,Kyle,"We set out to do something. I'm not letting our broship fall to the pandi just yet.
"
24,2,Cartman,"Alright... then let's get those vaccines to the teachers.
"
24,2,Stan,"Okay, let's do this.
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison," Hey! Hold on a second, everybody!  I think I can help things out here!
"
24,2,Stan,"What the fuck is that?
"
24,2,Qanon Member,"It's him! It's the Chonen One!
"
24,2,Qanon Member #2,"He's come to save us all like the prophecy foretold on the internet!
"
24,2,Scott,"Wait, he's the Chosen One?
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison,"Listen! Listen, everybody. I -- I think I owe you all a big apology. I came in here expecting everything to just go back to normal, but... we've all been through the proverbial butthole of hardships lately. I thought we could all just magically be friends again. But relationships are very fragile things.  And in times of crises when we need each other most, it's sometimes when we grow furthest apart. But through it all, Mr. White here has taught me a very important lesson. Make sure you're on the side of the people with the most power. And so, I've worked out a deal with some pretty powerful people...  Alright, boys, do your thing!
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison,"It's Air Israel with enough vaccines for every adult in town!
"
24,2,Gerald," Hey, Garrison! Good job!
"
24,2,Stephen,"Yeah! You're alright, Garrison!
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison," Oh, jeez. Thanks, everybody.
"
24,2,Cartman,"Well, come on you guys! Let's get inside!
"
24,2,Kyle,"Mrs. Nelson? We're here!
"
24,2,Mr. Mackey," Boys! Boys, you made it! 
"
24,2,Cartman,"Of course we made it!  'Cause our broship can survive anything!
"
24,2,Stan,"Hello, Mrs. Nelson! 
"
24,2,Kyle,"We got your vaccination for you, Mrs. Nelson.
"
24,2,Mrs. Nelson,"Boys... you really did it. I -- I can't believe it. For a while there, I thought I --  Excuse me. I thought I wasn't gonna --  gosh, excuse me. 
"
24,2,Father Maxi,"As a teacher, Mrs. Nelson did everything she could for her students. So it seems even more unfair that she... was just a few days late in getting the vaccine before she died of COVID. And now as Mr. Garrison takes over teaching for Mrs. Nelson permanently...  I think we should all take a moment to say... Hey! The rest of us made it, South Park! We're on the other side of this damn thing!  And so it's time for adults to screw these masks and party like it's 2021!
"
24,2,Unnamed Man 7," Hey, look at Walgreens! Nobody's going!
"
24,2,Unnamed Man 8,"Yeah, that place used to be so cool and now it's lame!
"
24,2,Randy," So we still have some of the pandemic special, but the vaccination special is about out! Try 'em both -- the season is about over, guys!
"
24,2,Worker,"Back inside the retirement home, old people! All the fun places are ours again! 
"
24,2,Stephen," Adults are all vaccinated! Adults are all vaccinated!
"
24,2,Stan,"Well, I guess this is it... 
"
24,2,Cartman,"Yeah.
"
24,2,Kyle,"I guess it is what's best for everybody.
"
24,2,Kenny,"(What are you guys talking about?)
"
24,2,Stan,"Everything's gonna be okay, Kenny. I'll see you on Monday.
"
24,2,Kyle,"And I'll come pick you up on Thursday, Kenny.
"
24,2,Kenny,"(Huh?)
"
24,2,Stan,"Hey, I wish you guys all the best, huh?
"
24,2,Cartman,"Thanks. I'll be fine. I already have some new bros I'm hanging out with.
"
24,2,Clyde,"Hey, Cartman!
"
24,2,Cartman," Yeah?
"
24,2,Clyde," Dude, they're reopening Casa Bonita this weekend. Do you wanna come with us?
"
24,2,Cartman," Casa Bonita?! Hell yeah, I'll come!  Oh, wait! I can't! I have fucking Kenny this weekend!  Shit! 
"
24,2,Mr. Garrison," Nice doing business with you... you little child-murdering pedophiles. 
"
