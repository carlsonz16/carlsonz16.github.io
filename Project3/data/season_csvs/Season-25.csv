25,1,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children, let's take our seats! Good morning, kids! So great to see you!  I know it's always a little hard coming back from a break. You know, you know, we've had a few distractions but let's just pick up where we left off.  Kids, over this last break, I met somebody. And, uh, I'm pretty excited. And, uh, we've been really enjoying each other's company, and, you know, things got physical. His name is Rick, and, uh, well, anyway I really wanted you to meet him, just-- you know, he's a – he's a little nervous, so just be cool, okay?  Come on, Rick. Oh, come on, you big silly, they're not gonna bite you.  Class... this is Rick.  Now, look, we're not gettin' married tomorrow or anything. We're just enjoying each other's company and seeing where this whole thing takes us.
"
25,1,Rick,"This is really awkward. I-I told you I thought this was a bad idea.
"
25,1,Mr. Garrison,"He's very shy, but I wanted you kids to know that he treats me really well. Way better than that narcissistic psychopath Marcus!
"
25,1,Rick," I-I should be going.
"
25,1,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, okay, well, you're gonna come pick me up after school?
"
25,1,Rick,"Yeah, yeah, you're done at 4:00?
"
25,1,Mr. Garrison,"I'll be ready like 3:30.  They like you. They do!  No, that's just them being them.  Okay, text me at lunch! Bye Ri-i-i-i-ick!  Oh, shit, it's Marcus! Should I answer it?!  I have to answer it. He's gonna suspect something. Just keep quiet about Rick! Don't say anything!  H-hey Marcus. What's up?  No.  I'm in the classroom with the kids. Aren't– Aren't I, kids?!  O-okay, you couldn't really hear them, but I'm with the kids. No.  Who's Rick? We've never heard of Rick, have we, kids?!  Will you fucking say something? Marcus, Marcus, I really don't– why?! Fine! Go ahead!  That's fi-fine! Okay, geez!  Well, nice going, kids. What is wrong with you?! You don't listen, and you blatantly go against my directions! 
"
25,1,PC Principal,"What's going on here, students?
"
25,1,Mr. Garrison,"I ask them for a response, and nothing! First they just sit there when I need their focus and their energy, and when I ask them–
"
25,1,PC Principal,"Hey! You kids know that these teachers are doing their very best for your benefit?!
"
25,1,Mr. Garrison,"I don't know how much more I can take of this.
"
25,1,PC Principal,"I am sick and tired of students thinking they can walk all over their teachers who gave you everything they got!
"
25,1,Mr. Garrison,"I've got enough problems as it is.
"
25,1,PC Principal,"I tell you what else. This Friday, for pajama day at school, this class does not get to wear their pajamas.  You heard me! No pajama day for this class. Now maybe you'll remember to have some respect for your teacher!
"
25,1,Cartman,"This is bullshit! They can't take our pajamas from us! Who does the principal think he is?!
"
25,1,Stan,"After everything we've been through the past couple years, they're gonna take pajama day from us, too.
"
25,1,Kyle,"We didn't even do anything wrong!
"
25,1,Cartman,"We didn't do fucking anything wrong! We keep not doing anything wrong, and we keep getting fucked!
"
25,1,Butters,"Guess that's just part of being a kid these days.
"
25,1,Tolkien,"Yup.
"
25,1,Cartman,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. We are not just going to stand for this?!
"
25,1,Stan,"What else can we do, brah?
"
25,1,Cartman,"Brah, we can have some Goddamn balls! What does Matt Damon say on that Bitcoin commercial? Fortune favors the brave.
"
25,1,Clyde,"My dad says that he listened to Matt Damon and lost all his money.
"
25,1,Cartman,"Yes, everyone did. But they were brave in doing so. We have to stand up for ourselves, you guys. I say we go right to the principal's office and tell him what's up, brah. 
"
25,1,PC Principal," Yeah.
"
25,1,Woman,"Some kids want to speak with you about pajama day.
"
25,1,PC Principal,"Alright, send 'em in. 
"
25,1,Wendy,"Mr. Principal sir, can we please wear our pajamas on pajama day?
"
25,1,PC Principal,"I'm sorry, ladies. I've made a decision, and I'm sticking to it.
"
25,1,Wendy,"Mr. Principal, we really didn't do anything wrong.
"
25,1,PC Principal,"I appreciate your sentiment, but as principal of the school, it's my job to make decisions and stand by them to maintain order.
"
25,1,Heather," Do you know how long we've waited for pajama day?! You can't force us to wear normal clothes! What is this, Nazi Germany?!
"
25,1,PC Principal,"Hey! How many times have I told you kids not to bring up Nazi Germany when you don't get something you want?!
"
25,1,Heather," You're a fascist!
"
25,1,PC Principal,"Get out!
"
25,1,Heather,"You're a fascist, and this whole school stinks of Nazis!
"
25,1,PC Principal," I can't believe the things these students say sometimes.
"
25,1,Mr. Mackey,"You better quit while you're ahead.
"
25,1,PC Principal,"What?
"
25,1,Mr. Mackey,"You don't understand how important pajama day is to kids. It's like the Met Gala for children.
"
25,1,PC Principal,"If I change my mind now, I look weak.
"
25,1,Mr. Mackey,"Mmkay... but I don't think this is gonna end up the way you want it to. 
"
25,1,Boy,"Hey look, it's Eric Cartman!
"
25,1,Liane," Eric! Eric!  it's okay! What's wrong?!
"
25,1,Cartman,"panting] Oh, God! I-I was at the school and it– it was pajama day, and I– I didn't have pajamas on and then I died! And then I died!
"
25,1,Liane,"Shh! Eric! Eric, it's okay, sweetie. Shh.
"
25,1,PC Principal,"Yes hello, Ms. Cartman. This is the school principal returning your call. What can I do for you?
"
25,1,Liane,"Uh, yes, I understand that you told my child that he isn't allowed to wear pajamas this Friday? What is this, Nazi Germany?
"
25,1,PC Principal,"Your son is part of a class that lost their pajama day privilege, correct.
"
25,1,Liane,"Well, I'm sorry, but I don't think it's safe for Eric to not wear his pajamas on pajama day. He could die.
"
25,1,PC Principal,"Well I've already made my decision, and it's final.
"
25,1,Liane,"Well, I'm not really sure where you get off telling me what my son can and can't wear. What do you think about that?
"
25,1,Cartman,"Yeah, get 'em, mom! Tell him to fuck off!
"
25,1,Liane,"In fact, I think you can fuck off.
"
25,1,PC Principal,"Ms. Cartman, if you are worried about your son's safety, then perhaps you should just keep him home for pajama day.
"
25,1,Liane,"Uh, I can just keep him home on pajama day?
"
25,1,Cartman,"No, I can't stay home because you have to go to work because fucking Matt Damon told you fortune favors the brave and now you lost all your fucking money!
"
25,1,Liane,"Matt Damon told me fortune favors the brave, and I lost all my fucking money!
"
25,1,PC Principal,"I'm sorry?
"
25,1,Liane,"I'm going to rally all the parents, and I'm going to the press! If my son can't wear his pajamas to school, then no kids are going to wear their pajamas to school! 
"
25,1,Cartman,"Fuck yes, mom, that was fucking sweet! Wait, no, I want to wear my fucking pajamas to school! You fucked it up, Mom!
"
25,1,Reporter,"Tom, guten tag and heil Hitler. Apparently, we are living in Nazi Germany. The elementary school behind me is telling some students they can't wear their pajamas to pajama day. The principal of the school says the students are being reprimanded for bad behavior. But many parents are left wondering... nehmen sie meinen Schlafanzug? The school's mandate has caused a backlash with members of the community who are now wearing their pajamas to work in protest!
"
25,1,Laurie Berkner,"Pajama time! 
"
25,1,Randy,"Making a difference can be fun!
"
25,1,PC Principal,"Testaburger!
"
25,1,Wendy," Oh, fuck!
"
25,1,PC Principal,"I need to talk to you now! 
"
25,1,Wendy,"Yes?
"
25,1,PC Principal,"Ms. Testaburger, I need you to get me out of this.
"
25,1,Wendy,"Sir?
"
25,1,PC Principal,"I made a tactical decision. Now if I go back and say maybe I was wrong, I look weak.
"
25,1,Wendy,"Well, Mr. principal, if you just–
"
25,1,PC Principal,"Zip it! I need you to get everyone in your class to work together and have Mr. Garrison come to me saying your pajama day should be reinstated. You get the girls and the boys to work together. This is your problem now, Testaburger. 
"
25,1,Frank,"Hey, guys– I just wanna say I'm really proud to be a part of this office. Wearing our pajamas shows that we care about those school kids– that we care about other people. South Park Realtors!
"
25,1,All,"South Park Realtors!
"
25,1,Mike,"Hey guys– sorry I'm a little late. Got a flat tire on the interstate.  What's the latest news?
"
25,1,Frank," What's going on, Mike?
"
25,1,Mike,"Well, what do you mean?
"
25,1,Frank,"You're not wearing... pajamas.
"
25,1,Mike,"Oh– yeah– I-I didn't really wanna wear pajamas.
"
25,1,Frank,"We're all wearing pajamas.
"
25,1,Mike,"Yeah, I just didn't want to with the rain and slush outside. It just... didn't make any sense to wear pajamas.
"
25,1,Unnamed Man #1,"Uh, Mike, we're trying to do the right thing, and it only works if we all wear pajamas.
"
25,1,Mike,"Well you can't force me to wear pajamas! What is this, Nazi Germany?
"
25,1,Frank,"We aren't telling you to wear pajamas– he walks over and opens the door] But I'm pretty sure this sign right here on the door says you have to wear pajamas!
"
25,1,Unnamed Man #2,"Hey, Mike, just put on some pajamas. It's not a big deal.
"
25,1,Mike,"Good, if it's not a big deal, then I'll choose not to wear pajamas.
"
25,1,Unnamed Woman #1,"You redneck, gun toting piece of shit.
"
25,1,Cartman,"Ladies and gentlemen. We have been at war for too long. Yesterday, Wendy Testaburger came to me and said we need to get the boys and girls together to find a solution for pajama day. I was delighted.  We must put our differences aside, because we all want one thing. The right to be in our jam jams this Friday all cozy wozy.
"
25,1,Heather,"It's comfy womfy.
"
25,1,Cartman,"Comfy womfy, cozy wozy, the point is, we are getting fucked.
"
25,1,Wendy,"We all have to be on the same page here.
"
25,1,Cartman,"That's right. We need all of us. Boys and girls working together.  And so together, what are we going to do?
"
25,1,Butters," We could shoot up the school!
"
25,1,Cartman,"Shoot up the school, nice. It's just done a lot. Anything a little more original?
"
25,1,Craig,"We burn down the cafeteria?
"
25,1,Jimmy,"We smear human shit on all the windows?
"
25,1,Wendy,"We apologize.  You guys want a chance to save pajama day? Then join us in telling Mr. Garrison we're all sorry.
"
25,1,Craig,"We didn't fucking do anything.
"
25,1,Wendy,"At school tomorrow, we all tell Mr. Garrison he was right and that we've been terrible students. That we weren't listening and that he deserves to be angry with us. We tell him how much we care and that we want to see him more as a human being than just a teacher.
"
25,1,Cartman,"That is just the kind of manipulative, psychotic thinking that we needed.
"
25,1,Stan,"We can do this! 
"
25,1,Wendy,"We just have to be brave.
"
25,1,Cartman,"But not too brave or else Matt Damon will come and take all our money.
"
25,1,Craig,"Alright, dude, can we lay off the Matt Damon jokes, please? They're just getting old.
"
25,1,Reporter,"Tom, warm up the wienerschnitzel and put on your lederhosen, because now people are being told to stop making Matt Damon jokes. Opponents are claiming that the jokes are already tired and Matt Damon had every right to make a Bitcoin commercial, so the jokes need to stop. All we can say is– Verzeihung für die Witze. 'Cause it's gettin' real Nazi Germany up in here. Back to you, Tom.
"
25,1,IHOP Customer,"This is totally ridiculous, you know that, right?
"
25,1,Sarah,"I'm sorry, sir, but we aren't seating anyone who isn't wearing their pajamas.
"
25,1,IHOP Customer,"Please, ma'am, I just want to sit down and eat.
"
25,1,Sarah,"I understand, but the management prefers that everyone inside be nice and comfy womfy.
"
25,1,IHOP Customer,"So I have to be comfy womfy to get a Rooty Tooty Fresh N' Fruity?
"
25,1,Sarah,"Sir, I'm just the hostess here. If you prefer, you only need to wear your pajamas to get in. You don't have to wear them at your table while you're actively eating.
"
25,1,IHOP Customer,"So it's okay if we put on our pajamas, walk through the whole restaurant to the table, and then take our pajamas off. What is the fucking point?! 
"
25,1,Police Officer #1,"What seems to be the problem here? 
"
25,1,IHOP Customer,"Oh, I see! Bringst du mich ins Gefängnis? Bringst du mich der Führer? 
"
25,1,Wendy,"Remember... no matter how angry he is, tell him he's right. 
"
25,1,Mr. Garrison,"Good morning, class!  Good mornin'! Good morning'! Good mornin', good mornin'. To you and you and and you and you!  So... how are you guys?  You're probably wondering how things are with Rick. I just flat out told him that Marcus was still calling me and you know what Rick said? He said, ""If you're not over Marcus, then take some time. I'll be here."" Is that not the sweetest thing you've ever heard? I called him back like three minutes later and I said, ""I don't need time. I need you."" I said, ""Can I just come over?"" And the way he held me when I got to his house, it was like, ""Ohhh, this is security."" And then later on when we were in bed, I'd had my head on his chest, and I was just playing with his chest hairs a little bit, and I said– Excuse me, Butters, are you paying attention?  Could somebody wake Butters up, please?
"
25,1,Kyle,"Dude!
"
25,1,Butters,"Wuh huh huh?! Yes?
"
25,1,Mr. Garrison,"I'm sorry Butters, am I boring you?
"
25,1,Butters,"Uh, no, sir!
"
25,1,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, well, then maybe you can tell me what Rick said when I told him about Marcus?!
"
25,1,Butters,"Uh... Huh... He...
"
25,1,Mr. Garrison,"Anybody? Does anyone know what I said when Rick held me tight?!
"
25,1,Wendy,"""This is...""
"
25,1,Cartman,"""This is really nice""?
"
25,1,Mr. Garrison,"""This is security!"" None of you are paying attention! None of you know the answers, do you?!
"
25,1,PC Principal,"What's going on, students?
"
25,1,Cartman,"Aw, God damnit!
"
25,1,Yates,"Jesus, I've never seen so many arrests in one day!
"
25,1,Police Officer #2,"Sir, we got another one.
"
25,1,Yates,"But she's wearing pajamas.
"
25,1,Police Officer #2,"Yeah but she was caught shitting on the car of a guy who wasn't wearing pajamas.
"
25,1,Unnamed Woman #3,"That's right, and I'd do it again.
"
25,1,Yates,"Alright, put her in with the others.
"
25,1,IHOP Customer,"Hey, don't put that pajama wearing slut in here with us!
"
25,1,Police Officer #3,"Chief, they're asking for your assistance down on Brighton street,
"
25,1,Yates,"What now?
"
25,1,Police Officer #3,"Looks like we got a domestic dispute.
"
25,1,Yates,"Oh, finally something normal!
"
25,1,Mr. Billings,"I told her I just wanna go to bed! If you're not gonna let me go to bed then I'm calling the police!
"
25,1,Mrs. Billings,"He's just gonna go to bed wearing the clothes he wore all day! I don't wanna sleep in that filth!
"
25,1,Mr. Billings,"Well, I don't have to wear pajamas!
"
25,1,Yates,"Okay, Mr. Billings, but... you have to understand, it is bedtime.
"
25,1,Mr. Billings,"So what?
"
25,1,Yates,"Well, you should just understand where your wife is coming from. If any time makes sense to wear pajamas, it would be as you're going to sleep at night.
"
25,1,Mr. Billings,"I don't care what time of day it is, I don't ever wear pajamas!
"
25,1,Yates,"Alright, alright, listen. What if you were on a ski vacation. Hmm? A nice cozy condo after a long day hitting the slopes. The fire is crackling. You've got a cup of cocoa. You're telling me you wouldn't wear pajamas then?
"
25,1,Mr. Billings,"No, I wouldn't wear pajamas!
"
25,1,Mrs. Billings,"You would beg me for pajamas if we had a condo and cocoa!
"
25,1,Mr. Billings,"No I wouldn't! No I wouldn't!
"
25,1,Yates,"Alright, alright, is there any way the two of you could go to sleep tonight in this house together?
"
25,1,Mrs. Billings,"He's not getting in bed in his clothes.
"
25,1,Yates,"Okay, then you can just come sleep downtown at the station. Take her in, boys.
"
25,1,Mrs. Billings,"What?!  Oh, my God!
"
25,1,Mr. Billings,"Ha ha, bye bye!
"
25,1,Unnamed Man #4,"They're arresting people in pajamas? What is this, Nazi Germany?! 
"
25,1,Yates,"Take him in, too!  Arrest those people, and all of those people! This whole town is a powder keg about to go off. And tomorrow is pajama day.
"
25,1,Reporter,"Tom, es ist ein wunderschöner Morgen und der Pyjama Tag ist endlich da. Alle Kinder tragen Schlafanzug ausser es würde den Kindern verboten. Eine band spielt das traditional lied von Deutschland, und allen sind glücklich...  Lich rennen! Sie müssen gehen!  Pyjama Tag ist hier. Back to you, Tom.
"
25,1,Reporter,"Hast du einen Matt Damon witz gemacht? Ich habe keinen Matt Damon witz gemacht.
"
25,1,PC Principal,"What the fuck, bro?
"
25,1,Wendy," You wanted to see me, sir?
"
25,1,PC Principal,"Bro... What am I supposed to do?  Do you know what a principle is? A principle is something that you see as a fundamental truth. You do something that you think is right out of principle! That's why I wanted to be principal. Tell your class they can run back home and put on their pajamas. I'll hand in my resignation this afternoon.
"
25,1,Wendy,"Sir, maybe people won't lose respect for you if you change your mind. Saying you were wrong is sometimes the strongest thing you can do.
"
25,1,PC Principal,"You're totally wrong about that. When all these people see I caved in to their insults and their offensive World War II comparisons, I'll be done.
"
25,1,Wendy,"Then we can't put on our pajamas. Out of principle. The kids will be okay. At least we still have opposite day to look forward to.
"
25,1,PC Principal,"No, you– Wait. What did you say?
"
25,1,Wendy,"I said we'll be okay.
"
25,1,PC Principal,"No. What day is opposite day at school?
"
25,1,Wendy,"It's always the second Friday in March.
"
25,1,PC Principal,"Testaburger! That's it!
"
25,1,PC Principal," Attention all students, this is your principal. I need to inform you that a mistake has been made. Mr. Mackey, your counselor, totally screwed up the calendar. Today is not pajama day. It is in fact opposite day.  So we will be having breakfast for lunch in the cafeteria, and anything else you've been told to do, you can now do the opposite.
"
25,1,Cartman,"Fuck yes! It's opposite day!
"
25,1,Unnamed Woman #1,"Hey, Frank! It looks like it's over! The school says the kids can wear what they want because it's opposite day.
"
25,1,Frank,"It's opposite day? Well, shit, we gotta go put some normal clothes on!
"
25,1,Unnamed Man #4,"Aw, how come?
"
25,1,Frank,"Because we are people who believe very strongly in wearing pajamas to the workplace. If we're wearing pajamas on opposite day, that means we don't normally wear pajamas and we're douchebags like Mike!
"
25,1,Yates,"Alright, you can all go home. It's opposite day.
"
25,1,IHOP Customer,"Oh, then should I be wearing pajamas?
"
25,1,Unnamed Man #5,"I don't know what to wear now.
"
25,1,Unnamed Man #6,"You can't make me wear pajamas!
"
25,1,Yates,"That's fine, you can all wear whatever you want as long as it covers your dick and tits.
"
25,1,Unnamed Man #6,"You can't make me cover my dick and tits!
"
25,2,Spokesperson,"As farmers and cultivators of marijuana, we have a responsibility to society...  I know we all respect the crop here, and we seek each day to better understand the nuances and legitimacy of its uses.
"
25,2,Randy,"Let's go weed! Wew!
"
25,2,Spokesperson,"But we growers must face a harsh reality– Since the legalization of marijuana, communities of color, black and brown Coloradans, those most affected by the racist war on drugs, have now been locked out of the wealth creation of the industry.  Luckily, the public is starting to understand this unfairness– and many people are now talking of boycotting cannabis growers who are only white owned.
"
25,2,Randy,"Boycotting what? Wait... what?
"
25,2,Spokesperson,"We are seeing a healthy and dramatic spike in consumers who demand that their marijuana be grown by those who understand the fight for social equity.
"
25,2,Randy,"Ugh ahhug–
"
25,2,Spokesperson,"The bottom line is this– a completely white owned weed business these days... just isn't going to survive. 
"
25,2,Randy,"Guys... I wanna have kind of a tough talk with you. We don't really have any black friends, we don't reach out to the black community. Shelley, you never bring any black dudes over. I mean, Stan, your three best friends are all white.
"
25,2,Stan,"There's only one black kid in my whole class.
"
25,2,Randy,"Yes, that kid Token. How come you never hang out with him?
"
25,2,Stan,"I do hang out with him!
"
25,2,Randy,"In a group maybe, but I don't recall just you and Token ever doing anything. I've never seen Token here at the farm, just like the two of you guys. Why not?
"
25,2,Stan,"I... I don't know.
"
25,2,Sharon,"Randy, stop. We're not racists.
"
25,2,Randy,"We'd like to think that, wouldn't we? But... actions speak louder than words, gang. I guess... I guess I just want you to think about it. 
"
25,2,Stan,"Uh, hey, Token.
"
25,2,Tolkien,"Oh, hey Stan.
"
25,2,Stan,"Uh, listen, I uh... How you doin'?
"
25,2,Tolkien," Fine.
"
25,2,Stan,"Um... You think your family would wanna come over for dinner? Out at our farm?
"
25,2,Tolkien,"It's kinda far, isn't it?
"
25,2,Stan,"Yeah but... Look, Token, I think maybe you and I should hang out more.
"
25,2,Tolkien,"What are you talking about?
"
25,2,Stan,"I mean, we never just hang out, you and me.
"
25,2,Butters,"Hey, we never hang out just you and me either, Stan!
"
25,2,Stan,"Shut up, Butters. Look, just will you please just see if your family will come over for dinner? It would mean a lot.
"
25,2,Randy,"Ok, there we go. This is a farm fresh hemp salad sourced locally here at Tegridy! Alright, come on everybody, dig in.
"
25,2,Linda,"Thank you so much for having us over. This is really nice.
"
25,2,Steve,"We've never been to a marijuana farm before.
"
25,2,Randy,"Well, you know, with our boys starting to become so close– we thought we better get the families together! If they're friends, then we need to be friends! Huh?  Do you mind if I post this?  Check out our friends! 
"
25,2,Steve,"Randy... I hope you didn't invite us here because we're black.
"
25,2,Randy,"W-what are you talking about?
"
25,2,Linda,"It's just that the past year or so a lot of people have been inviting us over to dinner and then taking pictures of us to show everyone on Instagram.
"
25,2,Randy,"Oh, that's so lame. No, we really just wanted to get to know you guys better since Stan is friends with Token. You know... just out of curiosity– why did you guys name him that?
"
25,2,Steve,"What do you mean?
"
25,2,Randy,"Well– I mean, it's just kind of an odd name, isn't it? Like, some people might think you guys naming your son that isn't very cool.
"
25,2,Steve,"People have a problem with Tolkien's name?
"
25,2,Randy,"Well I mean other people just think it's a little... I mean, come on, I mean, I'm– I'm not calling you guys racist, but– why did you name your son that?
"
25,2,Linda,"My husband has always been a huge fan of Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit.
"
25,2,Steve,"I wanted to name my son after my favorite author. But she didn't want to name our son J.R.R., so we just named him Tolkien.
"
25,2,Randy," His name is Tolkien?
"
25,2,Steve,"Yes, you know his name is Tolkien!
"
25,2,Stan," I thought your name was ""Token"".
"
25,2,Tolkien,"My name is ""Tolkien"".
"
25,2,Steve,"Sorry, I don't think it's that weird. J.R.R. Tolkien is one of the most prolific, influential writers of our time.
"
25,2,Randy," Holy shit, that's what his name means?
"
25,2,Steve,"What did you think his name meant?
"
25,2,Randy," Would you like to see how we grow and process our weed?
"
25,2,Randy,"You see, it's all about refinement. Here at Tegridy, we believe the best weed is untouched from the earth– so we distill it down to its basic essence. Over there are our clean out vats and up here we have our first stage drying racks. Oh, real quick!  It all takes about six days from the field to a jar that we can sell. So... what do you think?
"
25,2,Steve,"It's... uh, very involved.
"
25,2,Randy,"Yeah, it takes a lot. You know– I just had a crazy idea... Our boys are best friends now... Why don't you come work for Tegridy?
"
25,2,Steve,"Randy, I have a job. I'm a very successful co-executive of a financial consulting firm.
"
25,2,Randy,"Oh my gosh– I was just saying we could really use a co-executive of financial consulting! Look, I... Would it be okay if... If I sent you some of our receipts and you could help us– financial consult?
"
25,2,Steve,"Well that's what we do... Sure.
"
25,2,Randy,"Oh my God, this is amazing. Here's to the start of something wonderful. Would you like some free weed?
"
25,2,Steve,"No.
"
25,2,Kyle," Hey Stan.
"
25,2,Stan,"Dude... my head is reeling, you're not gonna believe this.
"
25,2,Kyle,"Not gonna believe what?
"
25,2,Stan,"Token's name isn't Token. It's Tolkien.
"
25,2,Kyle,"Yeah, I know it's Tolkien.
"
25,2,Stan,"No, no, no, no. He's named after the guy who wrote The Hobbit and stuff!
"
25,2,Kyle,"Yeah, I know. J.R.R. Tolkien. What did you think it was?
"
25,2,Stan," You knew it was Tolkien like the writer.
"
25,2,Kyle,"Everyone knew it was Tolkien.
"
25,2,Stan,"No, no, no! No, no, no, no! I distinctly remember Cartman wearing a shirt where he spelled it T-O-K-E-N.
"
25,2,Kyle,"Yeah, dude, ‘cuz Cartman's a fuckin' moron.
"
25,2,Stan,"Wha– hold on a second! 
"
25,2,Cartman," Whatsup, dog.
"
25,2,Stan,"Dude, Cartman, did you know that Tolkien is named after J.R.R. Tolkien?
"
25,2,Cartman,"Well yeah, I just figured.
"
25,2,Stan,"Then why did you spell it ""Token"" without the ""L"" or the ""I""?!
"
25,2,Cartman,"J.R.R. Tolkien has an ""L"" in it? That's gay. Who did you think Tolkien was named after?
"
25,2,Tolkien," Stan? You out here?
"
25,2,Stan,"Uh, yeah, hang on a second Tolk-kien, just taking a shit.
"
25,2,Tolkien,"Oh, okay, sorry.
"
25,2,Stan,"Oh my God... I suck...
"
25,2,Radio,"This is your mornin' commute, South Park. Looks like we have a bit of slowing heading into town. There's like a truck and a couple cars... maybe take ya a couple minutes there. Also, if you're heading out of town on the main road there's a– there's like a car there, too.
"
25,2,Steve,"What the fuck? 
"
25,2,Radio,"Now let's look at the weather...Weather's looking like we're gonna have a little bit of snow. And the uh– 
"
25,2,Steve,"What the hell are you doing?
"
25,2,Randy,"Taking shit tons of Tegridy orders. Sales are going nuts right now.
"
25,2,Steve,"No– why is my face on a billboard?!
"
25,2,Randy,"Because we work together?
"
25,2,Steve,"You said you just needed someone to help with accounting!
"
25,2,Randy,"Yes, but then– you got promoted! I was gonna surprise you. Don't you see how lucrative this can be? I mean, we make a pretty damn good team in the weed business. I mean, we are Ben and Jerry– We're Ben and Jerry. You're Jerry, and I'm Ben.
"
25,2,Towelie,"I thought I was Jerry...
"
25,2,Randy,"No, you're a towel.
"
25,2,Towelie,"Oh, that's even better.
"
25,2,Steve,"I told you before that I'm not interested in the marijuana business. I don't believe in drinking or doing drugs.
"
25,2,Randy,"Doing dru– Do you remember when Bilbo first set out with the dwarves to fight Smaug? What's the first thing they all did? They partied their asses off.  Chip the glasses, click the plates. That's what Bilbo Baggins hates.  And then they certainly had an adventure together, didn't they? Filled with...  Lucrative treasure.
"
25,2,Steve,"You really think we could make a lot of money together?
"
25,2,Randy,"Ben and Jerry, my man. Ben and fuckin' Jerry.
"
25,2,Doctor,"Hey-hey! Stan the man! How ya doin' buddy? 
"
25,2,Stan," Okay, I guess...
"
25,2,Doctor,"The nurse said you came here by yourself. No parents?
"
25,2,Stan,"I kinda wanted to talk about something in private.
"
25,2,Doctor,"Oh, okay, pal. What is it?
"
25,2,Stan,"I think... I might be horribly racist.
"
25,2,Doctor,"Well, kiddo... you don't normally go to a doctor's office for feeling racist, but tell me what happened.
"
25,2,Stan,"So... there's this kid at my school, and... he's black. And his parents named him after the guy that wrote Lord of the Rings.
"
25,2,Doctor,"Uh huh, Tolkien. Great name.
"
25,2,Stan,"Yeah... well, I-I thought his name was Token. Like– like a black kid that's just there so that... like... there's a black kid.
"
25,2,Doctor,"Uh huh... and how long have you thought that?
"
25,2,Stan,"The whole time! I've thought that the whole time!
"
25,2,Doctor,"Wow. Fuck you.
"
25,2,Stan,"Huh?
"
25,2,Doctor,"You really thought a couple of black people had a child and named him Token? Why would anyone name a black kid Token? You're a piece of shit.
"
25,2,Stan,"No, I was just try–
"
25,2,Doctor,"You were just going along with the dominant culture of the white paradigm, that's what you were just– Get out of my office, you make me sick!
"
25,2,Stan,"I'm sorry!
"
25,2,Doctor,"I don't know what's wrong with some people. I wonder if anyone else thought that this kid's name was Token? Hmm? Anybody? Anyone else just assume his name was Token? Because that's disgusting, and you are the problem.
"
25,2,Stan,"Doctor?
"
25,2,Doctor,"I thought I told you to get out of my office, because you seriously make me sick– I'm gonna shit my fucking pants right now.
"
25,2,Stan,"Doctor, please, I don't want to be like this! I'll do anything, just tell me what to do!
"
25,2,Doctor,"Oh, you wanna change? Then I suggest you start doing a lot of reading.
"
25,2,Stan,"Okay, what should I read?
"
25,2,Doctor," And I suggest that when you're reading– you do it from the perspective of a black person! 
"
25,2,Narrator,"  The knight Pigwiggen rides on a frisky earwig, and sends his love, Queen Mab, a bracelet of emmet's eyes, making an assignation...  Old Tom Bombadil was a merry fellow. Bright blue his jacket was, and his boots was yellow...  It is told that in their beginning, the dwarves was made by Aule in the darkness of Middle-Earth.

Black puppy and white puppy
Play together in the backyard
Why can't we?
Getting rough with a brand new chew toy
Oh boy
Let's all get along
We all know
That puppies are the same wherever you go
There are good puppies (Mm-hmm)
And bad puppies

"
25,2,Judge,"As the owners of Tegridy Farms, you are accused of plagiarizing a song for your marijuana company. How do you plead?
"
25,2,Randy,"Not guilty, your honor.
"
25,2,Judge,"The complaint says that you asked for the rights to the song ""Ebony and Ivory,"" but when you were turned down by Paul McCartney, you copied the song into something similar.
"
25,2,Randy,"Not true, your honor. I've never even heard Paul McCartney's version. ""Black Puppy White Puppy"" is a song I wrote by myself on my piano keyboard.
"
25,2,Randy,"

Black puppy, white puppy
Playing in the backyard, why can't we?
Black puppy, white puppy
Playing in the back...



"
25,2,Stan,"Guys... lately I've been doing a lot of soul searching. I've had to ask myself hard questions, because for a long time now, I've misinterpreted some amazing writing. I've done a lot of reading... And I've learned why Sauron built the black gate of Mordor across the path of Cirith Grogor, which led into the enclosed plain of Udun. I've learned that the Mouth of Sauron was once a man, who commanded the armies of Gorgoroth and dismissed Aragorn's claim as King.
"
25,2,Cartman," I think Stan's lost his marbles.
"
25,2,Stan,"I firmly believe that everyone would benefit from the school making required reading of these books. Because if we don't fully know about Tolkien, then we can make some terrible, offensive mistakes. In fact... did you guys know that our friend Tolkien, who goes to school here, is named after J.R.R. Tolkien?
"
25,2,Butters,"Yup!
"
25,2,Clyde,"Yeah, I knew that.
"
25,2,Heather,"Why else would his name be Tolkien if it wasn't for the guy that wrote the books?
"
25,2,Stan," My point is, we need to petition the school to make Tolkien required reading. To better understand our classmate. I think maybe we all haven't done enough to make sure than Tolkien doesn't feel isolated and left out.
"
25,2,Tolkien," Guys? Can I come in now?
"
25,2,Stan,"Not yet, Token. Just another couple minutes.
"
25,2,Tolkien,"W-what are you guys talking about?
"
25,2,Stan," Just a couple minutes, bro.

"
25,2,Steve," Hey, guys, I've got something really exciting to show you!
"
25,2,Randy," Ohhhh, buzzkill...
"
25,2,Steve,"I had this awesome idea last night... and I couldn't even sleep, I thought it was so cool–
"
25,2,Randy,"Okay, what is it?
"
25,2,Steve," We do an entire line of cannabis based on all the different races of Middle Earth!  We do seven different strains in all, representing the dwarves, the elves, even the uruk hai!
"
25,2,Randy,"Uhh, yeah... no.
"
25,2,Towelie,"Everyone will think we're dorks! 
"
25,2,Steve," Randy, you seem not to care very much about any of my ideas.
"
25,2,Randy,"Well, you're just– you know, you're just not the idea guy.
"
25,2,Steve,"I don't seem to be the anything guy. I thought we were Ben and Jerry.
"
25,2,Randy,"Alright, look, I'm gonna tell you the truth about ice cream– Jerry actually doesn't do shit. Ben does it all, everyone knows that.
"
25,2,Steve,"Well, I don't want to just be here like some kind of... token black person.
"
25,2,Randy,"Oh, come on, I'm sorry.
"
25,2,Steve,"No. I totally get now why you want me around, and I'm not gonna do it. 
"
25,2,Randy," He doesn't even really sound like a black guy, you know that?
"
25,2,PC Principal,"Alright everyone, listen up! We have a special announcement today. One of our fourth grade students says he's done a lot of work and has grown as a person. And he'd like to share his journey with you. Please welcome Stan Marsh.
"
25,2,Stan,"Sup, guys. You know, I've done a lot of reading lately. And I'd like to announce that the school has allowed me to declare today J.R.R. Tolkien appreciation day!  These books go so much deeper than the Hollywood movies. And we see its influences everywhere in our modern culture. In fact, how many of you knew that our classmate Tolkien was named after J.R.R. Tolkien?  But you don't know that Lord of the Rings was an analogy for World War II, did you?! And I'll bet you didn't know that there was originally 19 Rings of Power that were forged by Celebrimbor! So there's much we need to understand. And so I would like to bring up the man himself. Come on up here, Tolkien! Come on!
"
25,2,Tolkien," I actually don't like Lord of the Rings. And I don't like The Hobbit. Just cause my dad's into that stuff doesn't mean that I am. I've always hated that my name is Tolkien, but I didn't really have a choice, did I? So please, whatever you do, just don't draw any more attention to my name. I can't stand any of it. It's just a bunch of nerdy, jive-ass dragon shit. 
"
25,2,Sharon,"Stanley? Are you feeling any better?
"
25,2,Stan,"Nope. Not any better, Mom.
"
25,2,Sharon,"Well, your friend Tolkien came over to see you. He's downstairs.
"
25,2,Stan,"Tolkien is... here?  Hey, Tol-kien.
"
25,2,Tolkien,"Oh, hey, Stan.
"
25,2,Stan,"What are you doing here?
"
25,2,Tolkien,"Stan... Are you ok? You've just been acting kind of strange the last few days.
"
25,2,Stan,"Yeah, I'm good. I'm... No, I'm not... Tolkien, I have something I have to tell you.
"
25,2,Tolkien,"Okay.
"
25,2,Stan,"This whole time, I thought your name was ""Token"". Like... the token black person.
"
25,2,Tolkien,"Wow.
"
25,2,Stan,"Yeah.
"
25,2,Tolkien,"Wow... Why would my parents name me something that means the only black person?
"
25,2,Stan,"I don't know. So I understand if you don't wanna be around me anymore.
"
25,2,Tolkien,"Well, it's not like I really have a choice. That's why I'm here. My parents just bought the farm across the street.
"
25,2,Stan,"What?!
"
25,2,Tolkien,"Yeah. Out of the blue my dad was just like, ""We're going into the farming business!"" And we all just picked up and moved.
"
25,2,Stan,"Oh, my God, this is great!  Mom, Dad, guess what?! Tolkien's family bought the farm across the street! We're neighbors!
"
25,2,Sharon,"Oh, that's great!
"
25,2,Randy,"Yeah, that's really cool boys– Wait, wha-a-a-t?!  What the hell's going on?!
"
25,2,Steve,"Oh, hey, Randy. What'dya think of the new place?
"
25,2,Randy,"Credigree Weed? How stupid is that?! Credigree isn't even a word!
"
25,2,Unnamed Man," Uh, hello, we'd like to buy a little weed.
"
25,2,Unnamed Woman,"It's our anniversary!
"
25,2,Randy,"Well, there's really good weed across the street! Tegridy weed?
"
25,2,Unnamed Man,"Yeah, we're just– we're looking for something with a little more... street cred.
"
25,2,Unnamed Woman,"Yeah, a little more cred!
"
25,2,Steve,"Well, y'all came to the right business, cuz this shit is hard!
"
25,2,Randy,"Oh, oh! He didn't even talk like that before! This guy is a total phony! Now just come across the street, and I'll show you some real nice weed made with Tegridy! These people don't even belong here!
"
25,2,Unnamed Man,"Wow, bro, you're a racist piece of shit.  Can we see what you've got, please?
"
25,2,Steve,"Hell yeah, we got all kinds of shit– Lemme give you a sample of my Rivendell Elvish Magic... 
"
25,2,Randy," They stole it! They stole my idea!
"
25,2,Sharon,"Who did?
"
25,2,Randy,"Those dickheads across the street! They took everything I learned about using black culture to make a bigger profit and they're doing it themselves!  Get this little prick outta my house! 
"
25,2,Stan,"Dad!
"
25,2,Randy,"Get him outta here, he's a spy!  Hey, fuck face! I don't want your kid over at my house, you got that?!
"
25,2,Steve,"Hey man, what's your problem?!
"
25,2,Randy,"You want a war? Well, you got one! Game on, asshole!
"
25,2,Steve," Game on, muthafucker.
"
25,2,Randy," Everyone back in the house. Come on, let's go.
"
25,2,Stan,"But Dad–
"
25,2,Randy,"Shut up! 
"
25,2,Doctor,"The story of young Stan Marsh might seem incredible, but the fact is many people suffer from unconscious biases.  If you or someone you know might have also thought the name Tolkien didn't come from J.R.R. Tolkien, then please call... 1-800-I AM A GIANT PIECE OF SHIT. Because you are the fucking problem.
"
25,3,Agent 1,"Yes sir. If you're looking to move out of the city, I think your family would love South Park. You can get four times the house here that you can get in the city.  A cortado? Is that like a coffee?  Yeah, we – we have a coffee shop here. Yes...
"
25,3,Agent 2,"We're up in the mountains about an hour from Denver. Do you think you could drive out from the city this weekend and I could show you some properties?  Oh, you have a Tesla? Oh, how nice.
"
25,3,Agent 3,"South Park – yeah, it's a charming country village. If you're able to work from home, I think you'll really love it out here.  LaCroix? The sparkling mineral water? Yes, I do believe we have that in our stores here...
"
25,3,John,"We're seeing a massive influx of city people moving out here to the country. And the truth is we don't have enough real estate agents to keep up with all the demand. 
"
25,3,Liane,"Well, I don't have much experience but I thought I'd give real estate a try.
"
25,3,John,"Mrs. Cartman, being a real estate agent takes a lot of intellect and a lot of raw talent. You have to get your picture taken. Get people to like the picture and go, ""Oh, I'd like to hang out with that person."" And then act like you like those people when you show them houses.
"
25,3,Liane,"Well, I do believe I'm good with people, and the truth is... I need to do this for my son. Our...rent is going up because of all the new people moving into town – and I don't think I can afford it anymore. 
"
25,3,John,"Well, then, I am going to give you a shot. Mrs. Cartman. For your little boy.
"
25,3,Cartman," God dammit... Oh! You piece of shit! 
"
25,3,Liane,"Hello, sweetie!
"
25,3,Cartman,"Mom! Where the hell have you been?! I've been home from school for like 45 minutes!
"
25,3,Liane,"I'm sorry, honey, mommy had some errands.
"
25,3,Cartman,"I didn't have anything to eat except Nutella. I was about to call Child Services!
"
25,3,Liane,"Honey... Mommy has some big news. 
"
25,3,Cartman,"What?
"
25,3,Liane,"I... got a job, Eric. 
"
25,3,Cartman,"I'm your job.
"
25,3,Liane,"Oh, honey – It's going to be good! Mommy is just going to be working a few days a week and you can be a big boy and take care of yourself.
"
25,3,Cartman," No!
"
25,3,Liane,"Eric, this has to happen. We can't afford to live in this house unless I make more money, and this job pays really well.
"
25,3,Cartman,"Wha– what job could you possibly have?! You don't know how to do anything!
"
25,3,Liane,"I'm a real estate agent.
"
25,3,Cartman," A what?
"
25,3,Cartman,"Hey Butters, I need your help.
"
25,3,Butters,"Well– Well, sure Eric! What's goin' on?
"
25,3,Cartman,"Butters, I have some shocking news... My mom got a job.
"
25,3,Butters,"Oh... Oh, and you're worried that maybe now your mom won't always be there to take care of you?
"
25,3,Cartman,"What? No, my mom got a job. My mom is dumb as shit and somebody is paying her to do something.  Have you ever heard of a real estate agent, Butters?
"
25,3,Butters,"Well, not really.
"
25,3,Cartman,"Yeah, well, neither had I.  So I looked it up on a bunch of those shows and stuff. You don't do anything. You just look nice and hug people and then when someone buys a house, you make money.
"
25,3,Butters,"Wow! Well, that sounds like a good deal!
"
25,3,Cartman,"It's more than a good deal, Butters. It's fucking legal theft. If my mom can be a real estate agent, then literally anyone in the world can.  We've got all these people moving from the cities into our town. I can probably be a millionaire in just a few days time.
"
25,3,Butters," Wow wee!
"
25,3,Cartman," Now, whatever you do, don't tell anybody. If anyone else finds out about this, they'll all want to be real estate agents, too. You've always been great at taking pictures, Butters.  I won't forget this when I'm rich.
"
25,3,Butters,"Gosh, thanks, Eric! 
"
25,3,Liane,"Okay, Liane... you've got this. You can do this! 
"
25,3,City Man," Bottled water. Bottled water. Bottled water.
"
25,3,Liane,"Hello there! I believe I spoke with you on the phone? I'm Liane Cartman with South Park Realtors!
"
25,3,City Man,"Uh-huh... uh-huh...
"
25,3,Liane,"Well, this is the house I was telling you about. It just came on the market.  It's a 2,300 square foot mid colonial home. Detached garage–
"
25,3,City Woman,"Pilates?
"
25,3,Liane,"Excuse me?
"
25,3,City Woman,"Pilates?
"
25,3,City Man,"Is there a gym my wife can do Pilates?
"
25,3,Liane,"Oh, you're about five minutes from the local gym.
"
25,3,City Man,"Pilates. Bottled water?
"
25,3,Liane," Oh! Um, you have such a lovely family! It must have been a big drive from the city?
"
25,3,City Man,"Tesla. We have a Tesla.
"
25,3,City Girl,"Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi.
"
25,3,City Woman,"Is there Wi-Fi?
"
25,3,City Man,"No Wi-Fi. Bottled water.
"
25,3,Liane,"Well, come on in, let me show you around!
"
25,3,Cartman,"Okay, this is a three bedroom house with bathrooms. Front yard and backyard.
"
25,3,Liane,"Eric, what are you doing?
"
25,3,Cartman,"Oh, I just got some clients here looking to relocate. These people are from the city.
"
25,3,City Man 2,"Uh, cortado.
"
25,3,City Man 3,"Bottled water.
"
25,3,City Woman 2,"Wi-Fi. Pilates.
"
25,3,Liane,"Uh, excuse me one moment.  Eric! What are you up to?
"
25,3,Cartman,"I got a job as a real estate agent, mom.
"
25,3,Liane,"You are not a real estate agent–
"
25,3,Cartman,"Neither are you–
"
25,3,Liane,"Now just march right back home and I will see you when I am done with work!
"
25,3,Cartman,"Mom, real estate is an open market. You're not the only one who gets to take advantage of all the city people. 
"
25,3,Liane," Eric, this house is being represented by South Park Realtors. You don't get to just walk in and show it!
"
25,3,Cartman," Oh, ok! That's fine! I have tons of friends in South Park! I'll get my own listings! 
"
25,3,Mayor McDaniels,"People, this is the most exciting time in the history of South Park. As you know, there are people from all over the country leaving the cities and coming to small, rural towns like ours.
"
25,3,Mr. Adler,"It's truly incredible for all of us. With this new surge of people from urban areas, we're seeing more town money from sales taxes, more profit in our local businesses–
"
25,3,Harriet,"My bakery has seen a 20% increase in sales. Oh, I just love all these city people moving in!
"
25,3,Tuong Lu Kim,"That's right. It's great to have shitty people. These shitty people come with their fancy shitty crothes and their big shitty cars. You know, and these shitty people have a shitty way of doing things that will expose us all to their shitty ideas.
"
25,3,Jimbo,"Yeah, and they've got city money and city lifestyles!
"
25,3,Tuong Lu kim,"Shitty money, shitty lifestyles. And they'll move here and bring their shitty famiries. And their cultured, shitty kids will hang out with our kids and expose them to their shitty ways.
"
25,3,Mayor McDaniels,"I've always dreamed of South Park becoming more than a little hick town.  And these city people bring with them... a new hope.
"
25,3,Harriet,"Here's to the future, everyone!
"
25,3,All,"The future!
"
25,3,Cartman,"Okay, so this is a three bedroom two and a half bath– come on in, everybody! 
"
25,3,City Man,"Wi-Fi?
"
25,3,City Man 2,"Wha– Wha– Wha– Wha?
"
25,3,City Man 3,"LaCroix.
"
25,3,Cartman,"You got about 2,300 square feet and there is a finished basement.
"
25,3,City Woman,"Oat milk. Oat milk.
"
25,3,Cartman,"Detached garage– stairs head up to the master, which is an en suite, if I remember correctly. Let's get on back to the kitchen... 
"
25,3,City Man 4,"Cortado?
"
25,3,Cartman,"You've got a nice, big kitchen, pretty new appliances. Door in the back gets you out to the garage.
"
25,3,Richard,"Excuse me, what are you doing?
"
25,3,Cartman,"Just showing them your house. Come on, let's check out the second floor–
"
25,3,Richard,"Our house isn't for sale! Hey! 
"
25,3,Cartman,"Nice, big bathroom for the two rooms up here. Tweek's grandma is staying in one of the rooms, which serves as an office space when she's not here.
"
25,3,Cartman,"And then, we are back down to the spacious living room!
"
25,3,Richard,"Will you please get out of our house?
"
25,3,Cartman,"Yeah, we're just about done– well, what do you guys think?
"
25,3,City Boy,"Macbook, Tesla?
"
25,3,Cartman,"I'm sorry, I didn't get that...
"
25,3,City Man,"My son left his MacBook in the Tesla.
"
25,3,Cartman,"Oh, sure, well, let's head on out now. We can take a lot at Jimmy's house.  It doesn't have such sucky furniture.  Let me talk to these guys and see if we can come up with a number.  I think I can get you 4 million for this place.
"
25,3,Richard,"Four million dollars, really?
"
25,3,Cartman,"I'll be in touch. 
"
25,3,Mrs. Tweak,"Told you our furniture sucked! 
"
25,3,Realtor,"Hey– Hey, John, I got some bad news. We just lost another client to the South Park Realty Group.
"
25,3,John,"What?!
"
25,3,Realtor,"We're losing people like crazy! These guys are ruthless.
"
25,3,John,"Who is this South Park Realty Group?! Has anyone heard of them?!
"
25,3,Realtor," It appears to be mostly one agent. A-A pretty young guy– Can't have been in the business that long– 
"
25,3,John,"Oh my god... That's a pretty damn good picture. How'd he get that kind of depth of field?
"
25,3,Realtor,"I don't know he's gotta be using some kind of soft filter– nothing I've ever seen!
"
25,3,John,"Alright, everyone! Looks like we've got some competition! If anyone thinks they can take our clients, they've got another thing coming. Everyone, get up. We're gonna retake our pictures.
"
25,3,Realtors,"Awwwww!
"
25,3,John,"No, no, no, we're getting our butts kicked, and we need to show this kid what we can do!
"
25,3,John,"Come on, Chris! You gotta look really welcoming!
"
25,3,Chris," Ugh. I'm trying–
"
25,3,John,"Come on, arch your back more!
"
25,3,Chris,"I'm, ugh, arched as far as I can...!
"
25,3,John,"Come on, Chris, you wanna lose another sale?! Arch your back more!!!
"
25,3,Chris,"I-I got it–!  
"
25,3,John,"That's good, we got it– Get in here, Carol!  Got it! Ok, next!
"
25,3,Cartman,"Hey, guys, it's Eric from South Park Realty Group. Are you dreaming of moving out of the city and into the countryside? I want you to check out Clyde's house. This is a 2,300 square foot mid colonial home – detached garage – now listing for just $3.5 million. Let's check it out.
"
25,3,Cartman,"This house is so spacious. I think my cameraman Butters can attest to this. Isn't this nice, Butters?
"
25,3,Butters,"Yeah, it's real roomy!
"
25,3,Cartman,"Just look at these amenities.
"
25,3,Cartman,"These giant, glass double doors lead to the unfinished backyard. Plenty of room here for a pool or a horse stable. This is just one of the amazing properties we have at South Park Realty Group. We've got other great listings, like–  Craig's house,  Wendy's house,  and my personal favorite, Kyle's House.  Get out of that sewage drain you call a city and start living the country life you've always wanted.
"
25,3,Cartman,"South Park Realty Group. Get out of the city and into beautiful South Park.
"
25,3,John,"Uh, Liane, you got a call, line 2. Sounds like a broker interested in 4600 Highgate.
"
25,3,Liane,"Ooh! Okay.
"
25,3,Liane,"Hi, this is Liane with South Park Realtors.
"
25,3,Cartman,"How's it going? This is Eric Cartman with South Park Realty Group.
"
25,3,Liane,"Eric, stop it.
"
25,3,Cartman,"Well, I'm standing here with some clients who want to make a deal on this Highgate place. They wanna offer $175,000.
"
25,3,Liane,"You are going to get me fired, Eric. And then we are going to lose our home!
"
25,3,Cartman,"$175,000 is a great number—$25,000 below asking, but you know you're never gonna get $200,000.  Don't worry, these deals are always like this.
"
25,3,Liane,"I am doing this job for us! So we can have a roof over our heads!
"
25,3,Cartman,"The HVAC all needs to be redone and you know it.
"
25,3,Liane,"I am not talking about this anymore!
"
25,3,Cartman,"Okay, that's fine mom, why don't you go to fucking hell?!  It always gets like this with agents. Don't worry, she'll call back, watch.
"
25,3,Cartman," South Park Realty Group, this is Eric.
"
25,3,Liane,"You are in so much trouble, young man!
"
25,3,Cartman,"Okay, okay... $180,000, but that's as high as I can go.  We got it.
"
25,3,John,"It just isn't fair... We retook all our pictures, and what does South Park Realty Group go and do? They go and make a video. And just like that, they take all our customers.
"
25,3,Realtor,"I think maybe real estate just isn't the same anymore. Maybe we gotta start making fancy videos to keep up.
"
25,3,Hot Dog Owner,"Excuse me, there's all these city people moving into town and I think I'd like to sell my property.
"
25,3,Realtors," R-really?
"
25,3,Realtors,"That's great!
"
25,3,Realtors,"Hey, hey, sir!
"
25,3,Realtors,"We can sell your house!
"
25,3,John," Move! Move! Get! Get!  That's a very smart idea! It's definitely a sellers market right now! It's good you came to South Park Realtors. What kind of house is it?
"
25,3,John,"Once in a lifetime, a property comes up for sale that it's so unique, it defies words. We know that good houses are getting hard to come by in South Park...and that's why we are so excited to bring you this exceptional new property.
"
25,3,John,"This is the historic Aspen Park Hot Dog. 200 square feet of pure luxury. Let's check it out.
"
25,3,John,"You want to move out of the city and enjoy the laid back country life? It's all here.  Find out more about this dream home today at South Park Realtors.
"
25,3,City People,"LaCroix? LaCroix? Wifi? MacBook?
"
25,3,Tuong Lu Kim,"Huh...sound like-a shitty people.
"
25,3,Tuong Lu Kim,"Oh, no! There's way too many shitty people! Go on, go, go! Shoo! Too many of you shitty people! Go on! Go on, shoo, shitty people!
"
25,3,Mayor McDaniels,"People... we have a giant problem. There are now so many city people looking for houses in South Park...that it could destroy our rebounding economy.
"
25,3,Mr. Adler,"Uh...how so? I thought city people were good for our economy.
"
25,3,Mayor McDaniels,"They are, but Mr. Kim has a theory, and I think you all better listen to him. Mr. Kim.
"
25,3,Tuong Lu Kim,"What's the one thing shitty people hate most? Other shitty people. Shitty people wanna get out of the shitty. If too many come here... South Park becomes shitty, and then all the shitty people gonna reave.
"
25,3,Harriet,"We can't let that happen. Not when things are finally starting to turn around!
"
25,3,Mayor McDaniels,"So then we have to find a way to stop this.
"
25,3,Jimbo,"It's the damn real estate agents! They're the ones who are going overboard. They only care about their commissions!
"
25,3,Harriet,"Yes! We are to tell the realtors to cool their jets!
"
25,3,Mayor McDaniels,"Realtors don't care about anything but money. We have to show them who's really in charge of this town...Jimbo—go to your gun store and get the necessary supplies. I'm declaring open season...on real estate agents.
"
25,3,Cartman,"Welcome, home buyers! I'm Eric with South Park Realty Group. We hope you're enjoying the provided food and beverages.  Yes, that's right. You know, here at South Park Realty Group, we've had some amazing listings—Craig's house, Jimmy's house—but I think you'll all agree that what we have for you today is a whole nother level. I present to you... Tolkien's house!
"
25,3,City People," Wha-- wha-- wha-- wha--
"
25,3,Cartman,"These owners have just moved out to a farm, and we're listing this house at just under $50 million dollars.
"
25,3,Cartman,"Yes! Go on in! Check it out! Make me an offer!
"
25,3,Liane," You are in big trouble, young man!
"
25,3,Cartman,"This is my listing, mom!
"
25,3,Liane,"I have had it with you! Come here right now!
"
25,3,Cartman," This is my listing, mom!
"
25,3,Liane,"Eric!
"
25,3,Jimbo,"What the hell.
"
25,3,John," Over here...
"
25,3,Jimbo,"What happened here?
"
25,3,John,"They're too smart for us. South Park Realty Group. We tried to keep up... took our pictures again—aagh! My spine is broken.
"
25,3,Mr. Adler,"Well, it serves you right for what you're doing to our town!
"
25,3,Harriet,"You're driving all the city people away!
"
25,3,John,"Not us...South Park Realty Group...they upset the natural balance. Real estate agents don't really do anything. If they start doing stuff, then the whole housing market goes crazy!
"
25,3,Harriet,"Where is South Park Realty Group located?!
"
25,3,Realtor,"They're showing a house... The Tolkien house... you have to stop them.
"
25,3,Cartman,"Agh! Help! Somebody call Child Protective Services!
"
25,3,Liane,"Eric, you're only making it worse!
"
25,3,Cartman,"I am not doing a co-brokering deal, mom, it's not gonna happen!
"
25,3,Liane,"This isn't about that, Eric, and you know it! You're upset! You're upset because you don't want your mom to have a job!
"
25,3,Cartman,"That isn't true.
"
25,3,Liane,"It is true! You're scared and you're jealous that a job will take my attention away from you!
"
25,3,Cartman,"You just want to offer the sellers a lower commission to list this house and it's not going to work, mom!
"
25,3,Liane,"It's ok to be scared, Eric. I know that I'm the only family you have, but you're making everything worse for us!
"
25,3,Jimbo,"I see one! There's a real estate agent right there!
"
25,3,Harriet,"There's a big one and a little, fat one!
"
25,3,Liane,"Eric, you need to stop this right now.
"
25,3,Cartman,"When I close this deal, mom, I'm gonna be the richest kid in town!
"
25,3,Liane,"It doesn't work that way, Eric! You aren't going to make any money—you're just driving up the market and none of your deals will make it through escrow!
"
25,3,Cartman,"Well, we'll just see in 30 days, won't we? Except for some of my deals, which have a 45 day contingency period!
"
25,3,Liane,"Fine, Eric! Will you stop all this if I quit my job?!
"
25,3,Cartman," And you won't get any other job?
"
25,3,Liane,"No!
"
25,3,Cartman,"And your only job will be me? And, you'll be home when I get back from school and have my mid-afternoon meal already on the table?
"
25,3,Liane,"Yes, Eric!..Yes...
"
25,3,Jimbo,"Hold yer' fire! Come on out, ya' damn real estate agents!
"
25,3,Liane," Don't shoot! I am not a real estate agent! I am quitting as of right now. And South Park Realty Group is no more.
"
25,3,Harriet,"We did it! We fucking did it!
"
25,3,John,"Real Estate is a delicate balance. It has to be left to the professionals. There's a great migration happening all over America. And if we do it right... Everyone ends up in a home...that they can afford.
"
25,3,Cartman,"I think it's cool we live in a hot dog.  We have everything we need here. We've got running water, a couch to sleep on. And most important, we have each other. 
"
25,3,Cartman,"Weak... I live in a hot dog.
"
25,4,Mr. Garrison,"Okay children, let's take our seats.  I know there's a lot of things going on and we're all a little bit worried. I've heard some of you express concern over current events, so I think we should discuss what's happening. It is true – Rick and I did get into a fight over the weekend.  Now, I don't know what you've heard and what you haven't, but Rick was wrong, okay? He's the one that needs to apologize.
"
25,4,Wendy,"We're not worried about that, we're all worried about Putin.
"
25,4,Mr. Garrison,"Putin? It was just a little noise when I pulled out. Nobody was ""pootin"", okay? And anyway, you kids shouldn't be talking about that kind of stuff! Geez!
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey," Uh, kids! I need your attention! We're doing an emergency drill this morning, m'kay?
"
25,4,Clyde,"A drill?
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, now, we haven't done these in a long time, but we need to be prepared if the Russians decide to nuke us. Now, when you hear this sound...
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey," The Russians are nuking us.
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey,"...then you need to quickly and calmly get out of your seats and get to the gymnasium, m'kay?
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey," The Russians are nuking us. 
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey," The Russians are fucking nuking us! Go! Go, go go!  We're all gonna die!  Come on! Come on! The missiles are coming! They've lost their minds! Run! Get to the gym! Get to the gym!  Come on, we're getting nuked! Everyone to the gym! It's our only chance!
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey,"Under the bleachers! Go! Come on, move! Everyone's going to die!
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay. That was... 22 seconds. That's not bad, m'kay. Now, if this were real, we would just all stay here and wait to hear from our government and maybe, maybe listen to some appropriate music. Like we did back in the ‘80s.
"
25,4,Music,"
Take your baby by the hand,
Do the next thing that you feel,

25,4,Butters,"Hi, Josslyn! Hi, Staci Mae!
"
25,4,Girls,"Hi, Butters.
"
25,4,Dressage Instructor,"Alright, pony riders. We've got a big competition this weekend, so let's line up and do our rails.
"
25,4,Butters,"Hi, Mom! Hi, Dad!
"
25,4,Stephen,"Don't wave at us, Butters!  Judges hate when they wave. He needs to not do that.
"
25,4,Dressage Instructor,"Okay, Staci Mae, nice trot. Here comes the jump.  Good! Very nice. Okay, next.  Good, Heather. That's good control of Sunshine. Good. Okay, Butters. Come on, you're next.
"
25,4,Stephen,"Come on, Butters. Come on!  Oh! He clunked it! It's okay... It's okay. Good job, Butters. Good job. Fuck!  We should just pull Butters out of dressage. He sucks at this.
"
25,4,Linda,"Oh, we can't pull him out. He loves it.
"
25,4,Stephen,"Don't you understand, Linda? I'm scared. The big competition is this weekend. Butters will be going up against the Russians. 
"
25,4,Linda,"Oh, look, here comes the Russian now. 
"
25,4,Stephen and Linda,"Boo!
"
25,4,Stephen,"Boo, Russia! Boooo! 
"
25,4,Man,"Hey, what are you booing a little kid for?
"
25,4,Stephen,"Don't you know who that is? That's Dan Solokov's kid! Dan Solokov? Who works at the Ace Hardware over in Meeker? Even the kid's pony is a Russian Etruscan!  You piece-a-shit communist! You won't take our freedoms away! Boo, Russia!
"
25,4,Music,"Games without frontiers...

25,4,Mr.Mackey," ""War without tears... Jeux sans frontiers...""  Yeah?
"
25,4,PC Principal,"Mr. Mackey, I'd like to have a word with you.
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, yeah, yes, of course, PC Principal. 
"
25,4,PC Principal,"I see that you've, uh, called for another nuclear emergency drill this afternoon?
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey,"Yes, that's right. We are going to be prepared.
"
25,4,PC Principal,"Well, Mr. Mackey, this is the seventh drill that we've done in two days. And I see that you also put in the budget for a bomb shelter and 20 VHS copies of ""Red Dawn"".
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey,"VHS is still really the best format when you think about it.
"
25,4,PC Principal,"Mr. Mackey, I'm starting to worry that this is sort of... nostalgic for you, like you're kind of enjoying this.
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey," Enjoying it? My job is to have this school ready. Kids need to know what Russia is capable of. Оставь меня в покое (Leave me alone).
"
25,4,PC Principal," You speak Russian?
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey,"No, but I've watched Hunt For Red October like 200 times.
"
25,4,PC Principal,"Mr. Mackey, I am not asking you. I'm telling you – stop with all the drills and stop putting ideas into our students' heads.
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey,"No, you – you're right, of course. I'm – I'm over-reacting.
"
25,4,PC Principal,"Okay.
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay...
"
25,4,Stephen,"Alright, Butters, you've just got two more days before the dressage competition.
"
25,4,Butters,"I'll do my best, Dad!
"
25,4,Stephen,"You're gonna have to do better than that, Butters. You see that little Russian kid over there?  That kid doesn't give a shit about you. He just wants to win and take what little patriotism our country has left.
"
25,4,Butters,"That kid?
"
25,4,Stephen,"You didn't live through the Cold War, Butters, but we did. This tournament is going to be turned into a political spectacle, and we have to win. Otherwise, I'm afraid we'll have to give your pony away to communists who slaughter ponies and donkeys to make skin cream. That's mostly the Chinese, but a commie's a commie.
"
25,4,Linda,"Better dead than red, Butters.
"
25,4,Butters,"Oh, Jesus! Not Melancholy!
"
25,4,Stephen,"Now, that little prick is trying to intimidate you. I want you to go in there and show him how an American rides!
"
25,4,Butters," Come on, boy! 
"
25,4,Stephen,"Butters! Butters, what the hell are you doing?!
"
25,4,Butters,"Well, I dunno!
"
25,4,Stephen,"You have to learn to control!
"
25,4,Butters," Come on, Melancholy, come on! 
"
25,4,Girls,"Ewwww!
"
25,4,Stephen,"Butters, what the hell is that?!
"
25,4,Butters,"What is what?  Oh, geez! Put that thing away, Melancholy!
"
25,4,Stephen," Jesus, Linda, what are we gonna do?
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey,"What are you up to, you piece of shit?
"
25,4,Butters,"Hello, sir. I just needed to talk to somebody. I've been having some problems at home.
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey," Uh-huh, m'kay, that's nice. That's good to hear. Why don't you just, uh, sit there and tell me about it?
"
25,4,Butters,"Well, it's just my parents. You see, a few months ago, I saw this little girl riding a pony and I said, ""Whoa! I wanna do that!""
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey,"Uh huh...
"
25,4,Butters,"So we found a stable and a trainer, and I started to learn dressage. And I got to lease a pony, and his name is Melancholy.
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey,"Yeah. Yeah, that must be tough. I'm sorry to hear that, m'kay.
"
25,4,Butters,"Well, I love to ride Melancholy. But now I'm feeling all this pressure to win. My parents said I have to win because it's against the Russians.
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, we – the what? 
"
25,4,Butters,"It's the Russians. I mean, I guess they're just really good at dressage, but now my dad says it's a matter of national security.
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay. Butters. Don't move your head.
"
25,4,Butters,"Don't move my head? I –
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, uh! They're probably watching us, so keep acting like you're asking me for help.
"
25,4,Butters,"Well, o-okay, but I kind of am asking you for help, ya know, because I'm feeling really lost and miserable.
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey,"That's good. Now listen carefully. What did your parents tell you?
"
25,4,Butters,"Well, they said if I don't do well at dressage, it could mean the end of all of our freedoms.
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey,"Jesus Christ... M'kay! Well, Butters, you know sometimes troubles at home can be bad, m'kay.  I need you to tell me everything you know about dressage.
"
25,4,Butters,"We need to have a serious talk, Melancholy, and I need you to listen.  There's a time to poop, and there's a time to work. And the best thing is to poop when your work is done. I-It's like when I'm in the classroom, sometimes I have to poop, but I have to wait until lunch break. If I really have to go, I can raise my hand and ask politely. But if you start to poop while we're competin', the judges are gonna deduct points. And then the Russians will beat us, and then you're gonna get turned into Chinese skin cream!  We have to do this, Melancholy. You and me have to focus like never before. Now, let's go show them what we can do!  Let's go! 
"
25,4,Butters,"That's it! You got it, boy!
"
25,4,Butters,"Nope! Nope! Melancholy! Over the jump, boy!  Come on, Melancholy!  What? W-Where are you going?  Melancholy, back to the jump! Whoa, Melancholy, Whoa!! W-What are you doing now?
"
25,4,Butters,"Now I'm not sure what's going on here.  No! No! No! Melancholy! Bad pony! I'm sorry, ma'am! Melancholy, to the jump!
"
25,4,Stephen,"What are you doing here?
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey,"Don't shoot... I-I'm just the school counselor... Mr. Stotch?
"
25,4,Stephen,"Mr. Mackey? What the hell are you doing here?!
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey,"What the hell are you doing here?
"
25,4,Stephen,"I'll ask the questions, I've got the gun!
"
25,4,Linda," We were just... having a look around...we weren't going to mess with the Russian pony. I-I promise.
"
25,4,Stephen,"Shut up, Linda!
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey,"Mr. and Mrs. Stotch, you know—your son has been having some problems on the playground at school.
"
25,4,Stephen,"What kind of problems?
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey,"Well, you know...bullies, and, uh, pressure for marihuana, you know, with— Don't fucking move!
"
25,4,Stephen and Linda," Aaah!
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey,"Now, I want some Goddamn answers!
"
25,4,Stephen,"So, you want them to win, huh? You're a traitor!
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey,"I'm not the traitor!
"
25,4,Stephen,"Yeah, right...since when do you care about dressage?!
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey,"Since I found out the principal is a Russian spy.
"
25,4,Linda,"A what?!
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey,"There's something very big going on here, and I think it involves your son.
"
25,4,Stephen,"Mr. Mackey... we were just here to try and give that pony diarrhea by feeding it Erewhon.
"
25,4,Linda,"It's the truth! 
"
25,4,Stephen,"We're on your side.
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey," I think I understand what's going on now... The Communists are gonna use the pony show as justification... to fire the missiles.
"
25,4,Dressage Announcer,"Welcome, everyone, to the 10 and under pony dressage finals. We want to thank everyone for coming out today to support these little riders.
"
25,4,Butters,"This is it, Melancholy. We have to do this. We have to be classy. We're not gonna poop, we're not gonna get a boner, and we're certainly not gonna have unwarranted sex with the ladies. Please, boy... we have got to get this right.
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey,"Hi, mom.
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey's Mom,"Well, hi, junior! What a surprise, m'kay!
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey,"Mom, I need to use something in my old room.
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey's Mom,"Well, sure, come on in!
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey's Mom,"Everything is still just as you left it, son.
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey,"Mom, I think World War 3 is about to start. I'm gonna do what I can to protect our country!
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey's Mom,"Oh, uh, m'kay, honey, I'll make you a snack.
"
25,4,Norad Director,"What the hell was that?
"
25,4,Norad Man 1,"Someone from the outside is logged into the missile defense system!
"
25,4,Norad Director,"Well, kick them out! Shut off the Wi-Fi!
"
25,4,Norad Man 2,"It's not coming in on Wi-Fi! It's some old, archaic technology!
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey," X equals ""The Russians are nuking us."" Print X, goto 10. Run.
"
25,4,Norad Employees,"Wooah!
"
25,4,Norad Director,"What are they trying to do?!
"
25,4,Norad Man 1,"It's just repeating the same line over and over. How did they get it to do that?!
"
25,4,Norad Man 3,"Sir! The computers are taking us to DEFCON 3!
"
25,4,Norad Director," Jesus Christ... it's dressage.
"
25,4,Kremlin Man 1,"Товарищ! Американцы взяли NORAD на DEFKON 3! (Comrade! The Americans have taken NORAD to DEFCON 3!)
"
25,4,Sergei Shoigu,"DEFCON 3?!
"
25,4,Kremlin Man 1,"Мы должны показать это президенту Путину! (We must show this to President Putin!)
"
25,4,Sergei Shoigu,"Президент Путин нездоров. В последнее время он выглядит грустно-ностальгичным (President Putin is not well. He seems sadly nostalgic lately).  Президент Путин! (President Putin!)  
"
25,4,Stephen," Oooh, no! No!
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey,"We're running out of time! Take missiles to DEFCON 2!
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey's Mom,"Here's your Sunny Delight and Steak-umms, honey.
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey,"Get out of my room, mom! Gawd! Get outta my rewm!
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey's Mom,"Sweetheart...are you m'kay?
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey," ‘Course I'm not m'kay! But you wouldn't understand, ‘cause you're a grown-up!
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey's Mom,"Honey...as your mother, I want you to know you can talk to me about whatever you want. Even if it's about being scared of gettin' old.
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey,"Things used to be so much simpler, mama. There was a good guy and a-and a bad guy. And we all... sort of came together and loved our country...not like it is now.
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey's Mom," Ooh, junior. I know that gettin' old isn't so much fun, is it? We all wanna go back to a time when we were younger. You're getting to be around 55. Your pee-pee doesn't work so good, does it?
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey,"How'd you know about that, mom?
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey's Mom,"Well, I'm your mom, honey. When a man gets to a point where his pee-pee doesn't work the way it used to, he starts to...well, sit in his room and play war games again, you know? But honey, those times weren't better. We were all scared. People died. That's not something to strive to get back to.
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey,"You're right, mama...I've been bad.
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey's Mom,"Oh, you're not bad—
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey,"No, I'm bad—
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey's Mom,"No, no, sweetheart. It-it just felt good ‘cause it was familiar. That's just sort of what us old people do.
"
25,4,Dressage Announcer,"It all comes down to this. Number 8-2-3, Davey Solokov and his Russian Etruscan. If he completes this last rail, he will be the winner.
"
25,4,Stephen,"We're all dead, Linda.
"
25,4,Dressage Announcer,"Rider...please demonstrate your trot.
"
25,4,Butters,"It's ok, Melancholy...we did our best... Whoa! Where you goin', Melancholy?
"
25,4,Dressage Announcer,"And here is the rail. Wait a minute—we have another pony in the ring!
"
25,4,Linda,"What's he doing?
"
25,4,Stephen,"What's he doing?! He's fighting for democracy! Go, Butters!
"
25,4,Crowd," Butters! Butters!
"
25,4,Butters,"Melancholy! Bad!
"
25,4,Davey Solokov,"Waagh! 
"
25,4,Referee,"10! 9! 8!
"
25,4,Stephen,"He's got 'em!
"
25,4,Referee,"3! 2!  1! You're out!
"
25,4,Butters," Waaaghhaaagh!
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey,"Let me—let me through! Let me through!
"
25,4,Stephen,"Mackey, we did it!
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey,"I know! It's amazing!  This is all a dream come true!  You know...the past few days, I've been re-living the past. But during this tournament, I started to change. And I just wanna say to the Russians—that if I can change, then yous can change! I know how it is when you're gettin' old, you know, and you're gettin' aggressive because your dick doesn't work the way it used to.
"
25,4,Putin,"Da... da...
"
25,4,Mr. Mackey,"But just because our dicks don't work doesn't mean we should go back to the way things were. In the immortal words of Sting—we all share the same biology. Regardless of ideology.
"
25,5,Kyle,"Dad! Dad, there's this new place and you can actually go and shoot each other, only it's soft BBs and they're biodegradable, and the guns are, like, totally real except you don't actually get hurt, and it's like paintball except for there's no mess, and the stuff all looks totally real, and it's called Airsoft and can I get one?
"
25,5,Gerald," Wha– Wha– What?
"
25,5,Kyle,"There's an airsoft field where everybody plays on teams, and I promise I'll take good care of the equipment, and if you think about it, it's a really great hobby for team building and learning communication and –
"
25,5,Gerald,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
"
25,5,Kyle,"I was just thinking if you could come to the Airsoft store with me –  please, please, please, all my friends already bought their stuff, and it's totally a way for us to play outside like you always say –  come on, please only we can't tell mom cuz she won't understand, but it's totally safe cuz you wear eye protection.
"
25,5,Gerald," Okay, okay, Kyle, breathe.
"
25,5,Kyle,"Here it is! Isn't this cool?!
"
25,5,Gerald,"""Airsoft Armory""?
"
25,5,Kyle,"Come on, dad! You gotta check it out!
"
25,5,Gerald,"My God! Is this stuff real?!
"
25,5,Kyle,"No, dad! It's Airsoft. It's like paintball, only it's way cooler and it just looks totally real.
"
25,5,Gerald,"I-I really don't think your mom would approve, Kyle…
"
25,5,Kyle,"Dad… please. I'm not a baby anymore. The other guys – they already got their stuff. We're playing today! Can I please just get, like, an AK-47 and maybe a glock?
"
25,5,Gerald,"This stuff is expensive! Is this really how you want to spend your allowance?
"
25,5,Kyle," Yeah, yeah! It really is! 
"
25,5,Gerald,"These are all, like, legal, right?
"
25,5,Airsoft Armory Salesman,"Uh, yes, sir. You see, you load these soft BBs into the guns and they just kinda sting. And you can put the soft BBs into grenades, rocket launchers, all kinds of stuff.
"
25,5,Gerald,"So it's all totally safe?
"
25,5,Airsoft Armory Salesman,"Well, I wouldn't particularly say that…I mean – all the stuff is safe, the guns and grenades and things… but – but not necessarily the people who mostly play Airsoft…
"
25,5,Gerald,"What people mostly play Airsoft?
"
25,5,Airsoft Armory Salesman,"Teenagers. 
"
25,5,Airsoft Referee,"Alright, Airsofters, let's listen up. Before we let you onto the field, we need to run through our safety precautions.
"
25,5,Teenagers," Bruhhh..
"
25,5,Teenager 1,"We know all the safety stuff – 
"
25,5,Airsoft Referee,"First, your Airsoft guns must all have a red tip –
"
25,5,Teenager 2,"Bruh, we know…
"
25,5,Airsoft Referee,"Second, there is no full auto allowed on the field.
"
25,5,Teenager 3,"Bruh…
"
25,5,Airsoft Referee,"Third, there is a 500 fps limit for your BBs.
"
25,5,Teenager 1,"Bruh, can we play now?
"
25,5,Airsoft Referee,"If you're hit by a BB, raise your hand, say ""hit"", and go back to respawn.
"
25,5,Teenager 2,"Yes, already, yes!
"
25,5,Airsoft Referee,"Alright, you guys are Team Rogue Wolf.  You guys will be playing against– where is Team Floppy Weiner?
"
25,5,Cartman,"Right here!
"
25,5,Teenager 3,"What?!
"
25,5,Teenager 2,"Bruh, no! We aren't playing with little kids!
"
25,5,Teenager 3,"Yeah, it'll be too easy!
"
25,5,Airsoft Referee,"Alright, fine! Then we'll split the kids up on two teams and each one will have a teenager partner.
"
25,5,Teenager 3,"Bruh, seriously?
"
25,5,Airsoft Referee,"Kid with the poof ball, that's your teenager–
"
25,5,Teenager 1,"Bruh!
"
25,5,Airsoft Referee,"Green hat kid, that's your teenager– Team B, those are your two teenagers.
"
25,5,Cartman,"Alright, sweet! Me and Kenny and our teenagers are gonna smoke you guys!
"
25,5,Teenager 4,"Go! Go, go, go, go!
"
25,5,Teenager 1,"Come on! This way! 
"
25,5,Cartman,"Yes! Yes! Yes!!
"
25,5,Kyle,"I got you, Cartman!
"
25,5,Cartman,"You didn't get me!
"
25,5,Kyle,"I totally got you! I heard it hit your jacket. Say hit and and go back to respawn.
"
25,5,Cartman,"You didn't hit me, Kyle! The BBs bounced off a leaf or something, 'cause–  Agh, agh! Ok – ok, hit! You got me. That was sweet. 
"
25,5,Stan's Teenager,"I'm outta green gas, you got green gas?!
"
25,5,Stan,"Yeah, I got some right here, partner! 
"
25,5,Kenny's Teenager,"Bruh, keep shooting!
"
25,5,Kenny,"(Yeah!! Woo-hoo!)
"
25,5,Cartman," Oh, my God… this is the greatest day of my fucking life.
"
25,5,Kyle,"Ow, oww!  Hit!
"
25,5,Cartman,"Yes! Yes!! That was so awesome!! You guys, Airsoft fucking rules! This is–  Ow! Hit! Hit! This is sweet!
"
25,5,Kyle,"That was so cool!
"
25,5,Cartman,"Best thing ever!
"
25,5,Kenny,"(That was fucking great!)
"
25,5,Stan,"Dude, I can't believe we tied! That was epic.
"
25,5,Cartman,"Yeah, well, Team Floppy Weiner will get you guys next time!
"
25,5,Kyle,"That was seriously the best time I've had in forever!
"
25,5,Kenny,"(Me too!)
"
25,5,Stan,"And you know what else is cool? We all have teenagers now!
"
25,5,Kyle,"I know! My teenager said he's gonna come over and show me how to clean my gun!  Cartman? Are you ok?
"
25,5,Cartman," I'm just really happy, you guys…  Airsoft is seriously, like, the greatest thing in the whole world. Well, here's my house. Thanks, you guys. For just a few, brief hours I forgot how much everything sucks.  Can we promise each other we'll do Airsoft, like, all the time?
"
25,5,Stan,"Hell yeah, dude! We just gotta keep our teenagers happy and we can play Airsoft all the time!
"
25,5,Cartman," I love you guys. 
"
25,5,Gerald,"Hey, Kyle… Uh, how did the Airsoft go?
"
25,5,Kyle,"I took a BB right to the face with a sniper rifle. It was so great, dad!
"
25,5,Gerald,"Are you sure this isn't all a little too much for you, son?
"
25,5,Kyle,"I'm not a baby anymore, dad!  Ooh! Oh, that's probably my teenager! See ya, dad! I love you! 
"
25,5,Gerald,"I love you too, Kyle.
"
25,5,Kyle," I got it!
"
25,5,Sheila,"Gerald… why is Kyle wearing my makeup on his face?
"
25,5,Gerald,"He's just… experimenting.
"
25,5,Mother,"Are you Kyle?
"
25,5,Kyle,"Yeah!
"
25,5,Mother,"I'm here to drop off Trevor. He said he is your teenager now.
"
25,5,Kyle,"Yeah, that's right!
"
25,5,Mother,"Okay! Well, good luck.
"
25,5,Trevor,"What time are you picking me up?!
"
25,5,Mother,"Just gimme a call– don't make it too soon, though, because I am going to relax.
"
25,5,Trevor,"Fine, go ahead, I'm glad! Go away, I don't wanna see your stupid fucking face!
"
25,5,Kyle,"Cool, dude, so, uh, you wanna, like, clean our Airsoft guns?
"
25,5,Trevor," I'm fucking starving to death! Can you make me some fucking food?!
"
25,5,Kyle,"Well…Like, what kind of food do you want?
"
25,5,Trevor,"Fucking leave me alone!!
"
25,5,Kyle,"Okay! Okay! Okay! 
"
25,5,Stan,"Hello?
"
25,5,Stan's Teenager,"Bruh, how do I make ramen?
"
25,5,Stan," Excuse me?
"
25,5,Stan's Teenager,"I'm starving, and the instructions are all stupid.
"
25,5,Stan,"Oh, is this my teenager? How's it going, dude?
"
25,5,Stan's Teenager,"It's not going! The ramen's all hard and I can't eat it like that!
"
25,5,Stan,"Well, you have to put the noodles in boiling water.
"
25,5,Stan's Teenager,"Where do I get water?
"
25,5,Stan,"You… Do you have a sink?
"
25,5,Stan's Teenager,"Bruh.
"
25,5,Stan,"Bruh, what?
"
25,5,Stan's Teenager,"I'm sorry I'm not a five-star chef!!
"
25,5,Stan,"Hey, man, it's cool! Lemme, uh– lemme slow it down for ya.
"
25,5,Swamp Sniper,"That one right there! Take him out!
"
25,5,Cartman,"Dude, Swamp Sniper rules.
"
25,5,Cartman," Hello?  What– What are you doing, dude?
"
25,5,Cartman's Teenager,"I need a bathroom!
"
25,5,Cartman,"You– You need to use my bathroom?
"
25,5,Cartman's Teenager,"I have to go to the bathroom– brah, what?! 
"
25,5,Kyle,"Dude, Kenny, the weirdest thing just happened. My teenager showed up at my house and he's acting really strange.
"
25,5,Kenny,"(Yeah! Mine too.)
"
25,5,Kyle,"Yours did too?
"
25,5,Kenny's Teenager,"Why do I have all these fucking zits on my face?!
"
25,5,Kenny,"(Dude, I don't know, I'm trying to think!)
"
25,5,Kenny's Teenager,"You don't even fucking care! You don't care because you don't even fucking know me!! 
"
25,5,Kyle,"What the hell are these things?
"
25,5,Stan,"Dude, that's my friend Kenny, we gotta kill him!
"
25,5,Stan's Teenager,"I don't take orders from you!
"
25,5,Stan,"Okay, okay, but if we kill Kenny we get a point, right? Come on!
"
25,5,Kenny,"(Agh! Hit, hit, hit!) 
"
25,5,Airsoft Referee,"Hey, hey, hey! No shooting from less than 10 feet!
"
25,5,Stan's Teenager,"I wasn't less than 10 feet!
"
25,5,Stan,"It's okay, it's fine. We're sorry.
"
25,5,Stan's Teenager,"I'm not gonna play anymore. This is stupid!
"
25,5,Stan,"Dude, it's ok, it's just a gay rule. Come on, let's beat these guys!
"
25,5,Teenager 1,"Hit!
"
25,5,Stan," Dude, Kyle, where are you? We started playing like 20 minutes ago.
"
25,5,Kyle,"Yeah, I know! My teenager asked me to take him shopping for hair gel.
"
25,5,Stan,"Hair gel?! What the fuck, dude, we're getting killed out here!
"
25,5,Kyle,"Just do your best, I'll be there as fast as I can!  Okay, here it is. This is the health care aisle. Could you go a little faster?
"
25,5,Kyle,"Okay, here's all the hair product stuff. Which one would you like to use?
"
25,5,Trevor,"I don't know.
"
25,5,Kyle,"What?
"
25,5,Trevor," I don't know!
"
25,5,Cartman," Kyle? What are you doing here?
"
25,5,Kyle,"Ugh, nothing, I'm… I'm just shopping with my teenager.
"
25,5,Trevor,"Can we go now?
"
25,5,Kyle,"Okay, but you asked me if I could buy you some hair gel.
"
25,5,Trevor,"Shut up…
"
25,5,Cartman,"Well, at least I'm not the only one dealing with this crap.
"
25,5,Kyle,"Your guy wants hair gel, too?
"
25,5,Cartman,"No, my teenager wants more lotion.  All this guy does is hang out in the bathroom and go through like two bottles of lotion a day. I swear I don't know how soft you could possibly want your hands to be.
"
25,5,Kyle,"I just wanna get to the Airsoft field. Stan says your team is killing them.
"
25,5,Cartman," Damn right! Team Floppy Weiner will destroy you guys!
"
25,5,Kyle,"Yeah, we'll see when I use my sniper rifle!
"
25,5,Cartman,"You have to find me first!
"
25,5,Cartman's Teenager,"I gotta go to the bathroom.
"
25,5,Cartman,"Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me! There's one over by the registers. No, you are not taking the lotion! 
"
25,5,Cartman's Teenager,"I fucking hate you! 
"
25,5,Cartman,"Okay, I'm sorry you hate me. Just wanna fucking play Airsoft, buddy.
"
25,5,Stan,"Oh, my God, you gotta be shitting me.  Yeah—hello?
"
25,5,Stan's Teenager," I'm not gay.
"
25,5,Stan,"Whuh—what?
"
25,5,Stan's Teenager,"Why'd you call me gay?! Like, what the hell do you know?! You don't even fucking know me.
"
25,5,Stan,"I-I didn't call you gay.
"
25,5,Stan's Teenager,"They said I couldn't shoot a BB within 10 feet, and I just had to say bang bang, and you got all Salty and said I was gay.
"
25,5,Stan,"I was saying the rule was gay. I wasn't talking anything about sexual orientation.
"
25,5,Stan's Teenager,"Bruh.
"
25,5,Stan,"You're right, I shouldn't have used that word! Look—I was one of the first people ever to say there was nothing wrong with being gay. I had a dog that was gay!
"
25,5,Stan's Teenager,"Oh, so I'm a fucking dog now?! I'll fucking kill you!
"
25,5,Stan,"Okay, dude… what… do you want me to do?
"
25,5,Stan's Teenager,"I want you to just leave me alone!
"
25,5,Stan,"Okay, but you called me… hello? Hello?
"
25,5,Stan's Teenager,"
"
25,5,Stan,"What are you doing?
"
25,5,Stan's Teenager,"I'm holding my hand over a lighter! It's burning the shit out of my hand
"
25,5,Stan,"Okay, don't hold your hand over a lighter.
"
25,5,Stan's Teenager,"Bruh! Bruh, this hurts so bad! Oh dude, it's fucking black! Is that what a third degree burn looks like?!
"
25,5,Stan,"Jesus fucking Christ.
"
25,5,Stan's Teenager,"Dood, I just so lit burned my hand. I need like—I need like emergency services. Bruh, that was stupid.
"
25,5,Stan,"Yeah, that was kinda stupid.
"
25,5,Stan's Teenager,"I'm not fucking stupid!
"
25,5,Stan,"I seriously don't know what to do… I've tried being nice, I've tried being harsh… and I get nothing from my teenager. Nothing.
"
25,5,Kenny,"(Yeah…)
"
25,5,Kyle,"Well, you're lucky. At least your teenager doesn't threaten to kill you.
"
25,5,Stan,"I'd love him to threaten to do anything. I'd love him to do. Anything.
"
25,5,Cartman,"On the rare occasion that my teenager isn't in the bathroom, all he does is talk about his miserable life. I'm like—okay, dude, I've got problems too. But of course teenagers don't care about your problems. I'm like, ""Look, buddy, I live in a hot dog. Okay? Like, maybe let's stop bitching and just play Airsoft."" But you can't say that because then they're just gonna—
"
25,5,Boys,"Want to kill themselves.
"
25,5,Cartman,"Yes, yes.
"
25,5,Kenny,"(So, what do we do? Do we give up Airsoft?)
"
25,5,Stan,"No, we can't give up on Airsoft—I'm like $400 into this hobby.
"
25,5,Kyle,"And we love it.
"
25,5,Stan,"Except for the part about being around teenagers.
"
25,5,Kyle,"Well, apparently a lot of people are in the same situation we're in.
"
25,5,Stan,"What do you mean?
"
25,5,Kyle,"I've been reading this book—""Help, My Teenager Hates Me"".
"
25,5,Stan,"Wow.
"
25,5,Kyle,"Yeah…and… it has some interesting ideas. It says we're basically just dealing with an age difference and we need to try and connect with them.
"
25,5,Kenny,"(How?)
"
25,5,Kyle,"It says…we should take them camping.
"
25,5,Cartman," Camping?
"
25,5,Kenny's Teenager,"Bruh…
"
25,5,The Teenagers,"Bruh…
"
25,5,Stan,"Alright, guys! We got the tents all set up.
"
25,5,Kyle,"Yeah, check 'em out!
"
25,5,Kenny,"(Yeah, it's really beautiful.)
"
25,5,Kyle,"There's a lake over there where we can rent kayaks!
"
25,5,Stan,"So, what do you guys wanna do?
"
25,5,Stan's Teenager,"Go home?
"
25,5,Stan,"'Kay, yeah, we can do that later, but first maybe, um… let's bond a bit…
"
25,5,Cartman," Okay, looks like the tents are set up—can you come out now?
"
25,5,Cartman's Teenager," I'm going to the bathroom.
"
25,5,Cartman,"Okay, well, you should probably finish up. I know you took the lotion in there. You really don't need soft hands for camping.
"
25,5,Cartman's Teenager," Leave me alone!
"
25,5,Cartman," Come on, dude. No shit in the world takes that long.
"
25,5,Gerald," Hey, buddy, what's up? I thought you were gonna go out and play Airsoft today?
"
25,5,Kyle,"No… I don't think I'm gonna go…
"
25,5,Gerald,"Oh.  D-Did something happen?
"
25,5,Kyle,"You wouldn't understand, Dad. I just can't deal with teenagers.
"
25,5,Gerald,"Oh. Well, you know, they say that the… brain chemistry of a teenager is the same as that of a psychopath. The hormones and all that—it's been proven they're literally criminally insane.
"
25,5,Kyle,"You know, I just —I just wanted to have fun—and shoot my friends.  I-I just wanted to shoot my friends, dad.
"
25,5,Gerald," Oh, buddy. Well, maybe you could ask the Airsoft field to let you play without the teenagers.
"
25,5,Kyle,"We did! They said they hate the teenagers just as much as anybody, but they can't get rid of them. And we've got no one else to partner with.
"
25,5,Gerald,"Well… did you guys ever consider your dads?
"
25,5,Gerald,"Come on in, boys.
"
25,5,Randy,"Jesus Christ…
"
25,5,Stuart,"How long has this store been here?
"
25,5,Gerald," What do you think? This one can shoot a thousand BBs in like five seconds.
"
25,5,Randy,"Seems pretty dangerous. What if the police thought that gun was real?
"
25,5,Gerald,"No, it's safe. See? As long as your gun has a red tip and you're white, police won't shoot you.
"
25,5,Randy,"Oh, that's good.
"
25,5,Airsoft Armory Salesman,"How can I, uh… help you gentlemen?
"
25,5,Gerald,"We need some equipment. We're gonna try and take out some teenagers.
"
25,5,Airsoft Armory Salesman,"Uh… I think that's a somewhat foolhardy plan. Have you seen the kind of weaponry the teenagers buy? It's some of the biggest, nastiest weapons we sell.
"
25,5,Gerald,"Yeah, well, I've got something bigger.  American Express Platinum. Give me one of everything you have.
"
25,5,Airsoft Armory Salesman,"Yes, sir!
"
25,5,Stan," We… have completely had it up to here with you!
"
25,5,Cartman,"Up to here!
"
25,5,Stan,"Our friend Kyle just wanted to play Airsoft. And now he's quit because of your attitudes. What do you have to say for yourselves?
"
25,5,Stan's Teenager,"Bruh.
"
25,5,Stan,"Yeah, bruh. Great, thank you.  I can't… I can't…
"
25,5,Cartman,"Guys, things have to improve. They just have to. I've never seen anyone so disrespectful.
"
25,5,Kenny,"(And completely insensitive! What's going to happen when you grow up?! You have to learn responsibility!)
"
25,5,Cartman,"I've never seen Kenny like this, ever.
"
25,5,Stan's Teenager,"Fine, then just leave! Cuz we don't want you here.
"
25,5,Stan," And we don't want you here! We just wanna fucking play Airsoft without any of you on our team!
"
25,5,Teenager 1,"Fine, then why don't you just be on your own team?
"
25,5,Stan,"That sounds totally fine! Us against you, let's fucking go!
"
25,5,Teenager 2,"Fine and if we win, you stay out of our lives forever!
"
25,5,Stan,"Fine, and you too when we beat all of you!
"
25,5,Teenager 3,"Yeah, you and what army?!
"
25,5,Gerald,"This army!
"
25,5,Stan," Dad?
"
25,5,Kenny,"(Dad?)
"
25,5,Stuart,"Any of you pussy teenagers wanna Airsoft against some drunk rednecks?
"
25,5,Kyle,"We got new partners, guys!
"
25,5,Cartman,"That's awesome. I wish I had a dad. And that I didn't live in a hot dog.
"
25,5,Randy,"Oh, we got you a partner too, Eric. You might remember Stan's Uncle Jimbo.
"
25,5,Jimbo," Did somebody say somethin' about Airsoft against teenagers?!
"
25,5,Teenager 4,"Ow! Hit! Ow! I said hit, you bitch!
"
25,5,Stuart,"That's it, son! Light 'em up!
"
25,5,Kenny,"(Fuck yeah, Dad!)
"
25,5,Teenager 5,"Hit!
"
25,5,Teenager 4,"Hit!
"
25,5,Teenager 6,"Bruh!
"
25,5,Jimbo," Yee-haw!  But there's one teenager I can't seem to find!
"
25,5,Cartman,"I know where he is…  I'm so sick of this crap… 
"
25,5,Cartman's Teenager," Bruh! What the hell are you doin'?!
"
25,5,Cartman,"What you do to Jegens Lotion isn't right. 
"
25,5,Cartman's Teenager,"Ow! Ow! Ow! Bruh! Agh, bruh! Aah!
"
25,5,Cartman," Aaaagh!
"
25,5,Cartman's Teenager,"Ow, my dick! My dick! Aagh!
"
25,5,Stan,"They're not coming out of cover! I don't see them!
"
25,5,Randy,"It's okay, I have an idea…  Cover me! 
"
25,5,Teenager 7," Bruh…
"
25,5,Teenager 1," Dood… that's weed. I smell weed.
"
25,5,Teenager 3," That smells dope!
"
25,5,Teenager 4,"Dood, it's a whole lit jar of weed!
"
25,5,Teenager 1,"Dope! That is so dope, bruh! 
"
25,5,Teenager 8,"Bruh.
"
25,5,Teenagers," Ow! Aaagh! Ow! Bruh! Bruh! Aaagh! Bruh!
"
25,5,Stan,"Yeah!
"
25,5,Stan,"That was so epic!
"
25,5,Gerald,"Did you see how those teenagers ran?
"
25,5,Stan,"That was so sweet, you guys! I bet the teenagers will never go back to that place again!
"
25,5,Stuart,"Of course they won't! I saw half of 'em break their guns in frustration.
"
25,5,Kyle," Hey, thanks, you guys. We couldn't have gotten rid of the teenagers without you.
"
25,5,Stan,"Yeah, thanks, Dad.
"
25,5,Kenny,"(Thanks, Dad.)
"
25,5,Gerald,"Hey, that's what we're here for, right? We're just glad you wanted to spend some time with us.
"
25,5,Jimbo,"Well, I'm hungry, is there any place around here to get a hot dog?
"
25,5,Cartman,"Yes… yes, I live in a hot dog! It's right over here! Come on, you guys, help me get it all ready!
"
25,5,Stan,"Ok, let's go!
"
25,5,Kyle,"Come on, guys!
"
25,5,Randy," Should I take them out now?
"
25,5,Gerald," Not yet… we still have a few good years before they turn into monsters.
"
25,6,Sharon,"Eat your breakfast, Stan, you're gonna be late for school.
"
25,6,Stan,"You told me to finish my homework!
"
25,6,Sharon,"Do both, come on guys, we gotta get going. 
"
25,6,Randy,"Hey whoa, whoa. What the fuck is going on?
"
25,6,Sharon,"I'm about to take the kids to school, why?
"
25,6,Randy,"Hello?! It's St. Patrick's day.
"
25,6,Stan,"I know. I'm wearing green. 
"
25,6,Randy,"You guys this is Tegridy Weed's biggest day of the year. I need help with the St. Patrick's Day Special.
"
25,6,Sharon,"Sorry, Randy, the kids aren't missing school. Come on, guys, let's go. 
"
25,6,Randy,"Okay, yeah, great, don't worry about it, I'll do it all myself. Again.  Top O' the mornin' to ya! 
"
25,6,Randy,"This is God damn ridiculous. Piece a shit family.
"
25,6,Towelie,"How's it going, Randy?
"
25,6,Randy," Ugh, I'm just so stressed out! We have to make a huge profit today or the whole year is fucked. How's the St. Patrick's Day Special?
"
25,6,Towelie,"I think it's better than last year's.
"
25,6,Randy,"Lemme see...  Oh, wow... Wow...  This is gonna be our best special ever! Come on, let's get the truck loaded up!
"
25,6,Randy,"Let's sell what we can from our drive up booth, and then later we can hit the Irish bar. What the fuck?  Hey! Excuse me!
"
25,6,Steve,"Oh, good morning, Randy.
"
25,6,Randy,"What do you think you're doing?
"
25,6,Steve,"Oh. We're, uh, doing a St. Patrick's Day Special.
"
25,6,Randy,"No, you're not.
"
25,6,Steve,"Uhh, yeah. We are.
"
25,6,Randy,"So first you steal my idea of selling weed and now you're stealing my idea of doing a St. Patrick's Day Special!
"
25,6,Steve,"Pretty sure St. Patrick's Day wasn't your idea.
"
25,6,Randy,"Is that right? Okay... Game on, motherfucker.  
"
25,6,Butters," Loo loo loo! It's St. Patrick's Day! Looo loo loo! De doot be do!
"
25,6,Linda," Come on Butters, time for school!
"
25,6,Butters,"Okay, mom!  Ohhh dad, are you wearin' green or are you gonna get a pinch?
"
25,6,Stephen,"Ha ha... I've got a green tie on, you little rascal!
"
25,6,Linda," And I'm wearing a green scarf!
"
25,6,Butters,"Okay! Well someone's gettin a pinch today!
"
25,6,Butters,"Hey, Clyde! You got your green on! Hey Jimmy! Nice green pants! Tee-hee! Te hee hee hee!  Happy St. Patrick's Day, fellas!
"
25,6,Kyle,"Hey, Butters.
"
25,6,Butters,"You guys all look very festive!
"
25,6,Cartman," Yeah, it's super fun. St. Patrick's Day rules.
"
25,6,Butters,"Oh, I hope they put green food coloring in our milk at lunchtime again like last year!  Uh-oh! Hey, Kelly-Ann! What's going on?
"
25,6,Kelly-Ann,"What do you mean?
"
25,6,Butters,"Looks like someone forgot what day it was! Ha ha! Pi-i-i-i-nch! 
"
25,6,Butters,"I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to do anything wrong, honest!
"
25,6,Johnson,"Do you know what sexual assault is?
"
25,6,Butters,"I'm so sorry! Please! It's just... Well, she had it comin' on account of the way she was dressed!
"
25,6,Everyone," Ohhh!
"
25,6,Johnson,"Wow, kid, wow!
"
25,6,Officer,"Alright. Take this shithead to the station and book him for sexual assault of a minor. 
"
25,6,Butters,"Oh, jeez, I didn't know Kelly-Ann was a minor! Well, she didn't have a mining helmet or a pick axe or anything!
"
25,6,Yates," Okay, looks like you assaulted a nine year old girl... No prior history... assault took place at an elementary school.
"
25,6,Butters,"But... But, sir, it's St. Patrick's Day.
"
25,6,Yates,"Look, I know! It's St. Patrick's Day, right? If people don't wear green, they get pinched!
"
25,6,Butters,"Yes! Right!
"
25,6,Yates,"Yeah... Only one problem. The little girl you pinched? Kelly-Ann Barlow? She was wearing green socks.  You're a goddamn sexual predator. Don't let him jack off in here! These types always mess up my jail!
"
25,6,Steve,"Welcome, everyone, welcome. Thank you for coming to Credigree Farms!
"
25,6,Steve,"Randy, we all see you behind the bush.  Everyone sees you.  
"
25,6,Randy," Oh. Uh... A very happy mornin', everybody! And a foine St. Patrick's Day to all of ye. I don't know if ya noohticed. But, uh, there's a farm across the street selling weed also... And the owner is actually 10 par-cent Irish!
"
25,6,Steve,"So, obviously, you're upset that you don't seem to have any customers.
"
25,6,Randy,"What I'm upset about is a wee little thing called ""cultural appropriation"". Ever heard of it? That's why we can't wear sombreros on Cinco de Mayo. Why we can't dress like Indians on Halloween.
"
25,6,Steve,"What's your point? 
"
25,6,Randy,"I'm looking at my point, you racist son of a bitch. You have no right to wear that stuff. It is offensive. Come on, guys! St. Patrick's Day is the one day of the year we have left where we can actually celebrate being white. Any other day that we tried to be proud of our culture, we would get immediately cancelled by Twitter! And yet for some reason, you're all over here, buying your weed from someone who is fine mocking our customs and traditions.
"
25,6,Steve,"Maybe they're here because my St. Patrick's Day Special is better than yours. 
"
25,6,Randy,"Okay, yeah... Yeah, let's arrest the white leprechaun. Cuz, you know, can't have one day for a mostly white culture, right? Don't wanna get cancelled. I guess don't arrest him for cultural appropriations? Guess... Guess that only works one way, huh?
"
25,6,Public Defender,"Leopold Stotch?
"
25,6,Butters,"Yes?
"
25,6,Public Defender,"I'm the public defender that's been assigned to your case.
"
25,6,Butters,"Ugh... Okay... Oh, God... 
"
25,6,Public Defender,"Is there a problem?
"
25,6,Butters,"Wul, it's just... I mean... What you're wearing. You know, it's St. Patrick's Day, you're not wearing any... You don't have any green socks on, do you?
"
25,6,Public Defender,"No, I'm wearing yellow socks.  
"
25,6,Butters,"Ohhhhh God... I wanna pinch you so bad...
"
25,6,Public Defender,"I'm here to help you, okay? Now, this woman that you're accused of groping, were you two in any kind of relationship? 
"
25,6,Butters,"No, ma'am, could you... Maybe put on some green lipstick or something?
"
25,6,Public Defender,"Before you touched the victim, did she give you any kind of consent?
"
25,6,Butters,"Well, technically, yes! I mean, St. Patrick's Day is a wonderful day where we remember a British Roman man who went to Ireland and converted the whole country to Christianity! And he used a clover to represent the Holy Trinity, so we're supposed to celebrate that by wearing green and if you don't wear green you get a pinch!
"
25,6,Public Defender,"And who is this St. Patrick to you?
"
25,6,Butters,"See?! That's the problem! Nobody knows how great he really was.
"
25,6,Public Defender," Okay...  Can you show me where on the body you touched the girl?
"
25,6,Butters,"Oh, God...
"
25,6,Public Defender,"Did you put your fingers inside her?
"
25,6,Butters,"I didn't finger nothin! I swear it was just a tiny little St. Patrick's Day pinch! It was... It was like this!  Ohhhg!  Oh!
"
25,6,Public Defender,"I am not representing this fucking animal! 
"
25,6,Butters,"Ohhgu!
"
25,6,Officer,"We got some more St. Patrick's Day offenders.
"
25,6,Yates,"Well, it's 10 a.m. and you people are already wasted, huh?
"
25,6,Man,"Yeah, yeah, copper, you got me, big deal.
"
25,6,Butters," Dear St. Patrick... If you're really up there... I've always done my best to honor you on this most holy day... You went to Ireland, and you got all those pagan worshippers to follow Christ. If there's any way... that you could help me now... just, like, send me a leprechaun or something... I will be forever your dark servant. Amen.
"
25,6,Johnson," Alright, we got us another one! 
"
25,6,Officer,"Let's go, buddy. 
"
25,6,Randy,"Yeah yeah, you don't have to push me, copper. 
"
25,6,Butters,"Whoa... 
"
25,6,Yates,"When are you people gonna learn, huh? It's not even lunchtime, for Christ's sake. 
"
25,6,Randy,"I want my phone call.
"
25,6,Butters,"Wow wee, are you a real leprechaun?
"
25,6,Randy,"Yeah, I'm a real fucking leprechaun!
"
25,6,Butters,"Alright! Are we gonna bust outta here or what?
"
25,6,Randy,"Hell yeah we're gonna bust outta here, what do you have planned?
"
25,6,Announcer,"Awww, yeah... And now back to the Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special.
"
25,6,Steve,"Alright, there you go, happy St. Patrick's Day and thanks for buying Credigree! 
"
25,6,Farty O'Cool,"Good afternoon, sir! Are you the creator of Credigree Weed?
"
25,6,Steve,"I am.
"
25,6,Farty O'Cool,"Well, I'm the owner of the Irish bar here in town. Farty O'Cools. We've got thousands of patrons today and I'm looking to score some weed.
"
25,6,Steve,"You need marijuana for the Irish bar.
"
25,6,Farty O'Cool,"Well, everyone's been drinkin' since 9 a.m. But now they need something to take the edge off until they start doing coke at 7:30.
"
25,6,Steve,"Well, I'm sure we can help you out. How much Credigree are you looking to buy?
"
25,6,Farty O'Cool,"Oh, I'd say we need about... Oh, two and a half tons of yer St. Patrick's Day Special.
"
25,6,Steve,"Two and a half tons...
"
25,6,Farty O'Cool,"Alright! Well, we'll see ya down at Farty O'Cools! 
"
25,6,Linda Black,"Are you crazy? How are we gonna get that much weed together in time?
"
25,6,Steve,"I don't know, babe, but this could really make our whole fiscal year!
"
25,6,Linda Black,"I just hope you're not overdoin' it again.
"
25,6,Steve,"Don't worry, we're gonna blow everyone's mind with our St. Patrick's Day Special!
"
25,6,Cartman,"Awesome... green hamburgers... How clever...
"
25,6,Stan," Hello?
"
25,6,Randy," Uh, yes, this is Randy Marsh, I've been incarcerated. I need to speak with my attorney.
"
25,6,Stan,"Dad, it's me. You called the wrong person.
"
25,6,Randy,"Yes, I am aware of that. Listen to me carefully. The canary is in the cage.
"
25,6,Stan,"I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
"
25,6,Randy,"Oh, a confidential matter? Lawyer client privilege. Uh, you know, there's an officer standing right here, actually.  Oh... Oh it's okay, he's stepping away.  Stan! They got me locked up, you're gonna have to help me break outta here. We have to stop them.
"
25,6,Stan,"Stop who?
"
25,6,Randy,"Listen to me... is your friend Tolkien there?
"
25,6,Stan,"Yeah, Tol-l-l-kien is sitting right here.
"
25,6,Randy,"Yeah, well, his piece a shit dad is trying to take over the St. Patrick's Day Special!
"
25,6,Stan,"I don't care.
"
25,6,Randy,"You better care, because if we don't make money today you and sister are gonna starve. Do you understand? And I won't be able to pay the Wi-Fi bill.
"
25,6,Stan,"Okay, what do you want me to do?
"
25,6,Randy,"I need you to leave school, go home, and get a jar of the St. Patrick's Day Special weed and sneak it into the police station.
"
25,6,Stan,"Dad, it's St. Patrick's Day. We're gonna do a scavenger hunt at recess.
"
25,6,Randy,"I'm asking you to do one little thing. Ditch school, get weed, sneak into the police station. Do it or no more Wi-Fi, I mean it!  Piece a shit lawyer! 
"
25,6,Butters," St. Patrick was not Irish. He was a Roman British man who was made a slave by Irish Barbarians. But St. Patrick heard the voice of God... and he used his situation for good, and God told him to be brave!  And that is why... On this one day of the year, we must be like St. Patrick ourselves!  The police don't even care about St. Patrick's Day! Do you see any of them wearing green?! No! If we do St. Patrick's bidding, he will provide for us! 
"
25,6,Officer,"Okay, back in you go. 
"
25,6,Butters,"Pi-i-i-i-nch! 
"
25,6,Officer," Oh my God! Oh my God!  He just touched me and he didn't ask for consent or anything.
"
25,6,Johnson,"Okay, okay, I'll take care of it...  Is that better?
"
25,6,Officer,"I just need to take a shower and cry. Oh my God.
"
25,6,Officer,"Can I help you?
"
25,6,Cartman,"Hello, sir, we are with the Clover Club. We try to spread a little St. Patrick's Day cheer by donating baked goods to prison inmates who cannot celebrate this festive time. 
"
25,6,Officer,"Alright, it's your lucky day, folks, some kids brought you some holiday cheer.
"
25,6,Randy,"Wha... Wha... What's happening?! What's happening?
"
25,6,Stan,"Hey, there, we brought you a cake.
"
25,6,Randy,"I told you to bring me weed, not a cake!
"
25,6,Stan," God dammit. You... You should just enjoy the cake.
"
25,6,Randy,"You don't fucking listen to me, do you?! You're incapable of ever doing anything right because--  Oh, a cake.  Gooot it. Thank you very much. 
"
25,6,Butters,"Whu... Oh, hey, fellas.
"
25,6,Cartman,"How's your St. Patrick's Day going, Butters?
"
25,6,Butters,"Pretty good.
"
25,6,Cartman,"Awesome.
"
25,6,Stan,"Well, see ya. 
"
25,6,Butters,"What are you gonna do?
"
25,6,Randy,"It's simple... There's always cops looking to make a score. You just gotta find the one willing to trade some drugs for a favor.  And once they get a whiff of my St. Patrick's Day Special, they won't be able to resist.  Oh... Oh, man, that is strong...
"
25,6,Butters,"I knew St. Patrick would perform a miracle to get us out of here! Just like when he was a slave, he will help us go free!
"
25,6,Randy,"White people were slaves in history? Nuh-uh.  Gah, it's such a good special, it's just such a shame people are trying to ruin it.  Hey, my bruthuh. You got a second?
"
25,6,Johnson,"What do you want?
"
25,6,Randy,"You don't wanna miss out on the only white holiday still allowed, do ya? How'd you like to be able to, uh, celebrate a little?
"
25,6,Johnson,"Yeah, of course I would, but I can't. 
"
25,6,Officer,"Hey guys! How'd you like to be able to celebrate a little?!  Check it out! They're handing out free weed down at Farty O'Cools! It's the Credigree St. Patrick's Day Special! 
"
25,6,Officers,"Wow!
"
25,6,Johnson,"Ooh, hey, I'm in. 
"
25,6,Randy,"No!
"
25,6,Officer,"Ooh da lolly!
"
25,6,Officer,"St. Patrick's Day! Wow, look at it!
"
25,6,Officer,"I thought I wouldn't be able to get wasted till later!
"
25,6,Randy," That's it. It's over. My plan is done.
"
25,6,Butters,"It is not over! What did St. Patrick say when he was taken from his homeland and turned into a slave?! St. Patrick didn't give up! And when the Christians slandered him while he was trying to convert the heathen Irish, did he give up then?! 
"
25,6,Officer,"Man, that is strong ass shit.
"
25,6,Officer,"You can taste the Irishness. 
"
25,6,Officer,"This weed is amazing and it has so much cred.
"
25,6,Officer,"You know, I've never really been a fan of the holiday Specials, but this one is really good. 
"
25,6,Butters,"Yeah!
"
25,6,Officers," Whoa!
"
25,6,Butters,"You see?! The power of St. Patrick compels you! 
"
25,6,Officers,"Oh! Whoa! Aah! Aah!
"
25,6,Butters,"Yes, now use your clover rays! 
"
25,6,Officers,"Oh! Ugugghghh! Whoa!
"
25,6,Randy,"Me golden coins of spite! 
"
25,6,Officers,"Oh! Oh! 
"
25,6,Announcer,"And now for the thrilling conclusion of the Credigree St. Patrick's Day Special.
"
25,6,Linda Black,"My God! I never thought we'd sell this much weed!
"
25,6,Steve,"Keep it up, babe! We've still got a long way to go!
"
25,6,Patron,"Hey, everyone! Everyone! Everyone, quiet! Turn up the TV! 
"
25,6,Tom,"Once again the town of South Park is on high alert after a sexual predator escaped from custody. Everyone who's out at bars or restaurants for St. Patrick's Day need to be on the lookout for the sexual psychopath. 
"
25,6,Bill,"Tom, I'm standing outside the South Park Police Station, where just moments ago a sexual predator broke free.  Surveillance cameras inside the station captured the dramatic escape.  Police claim they tried to stop the felon from escaping, but they were just, ""Way too high."" Back to you, Tom.
"
25,6,Towelie," I've been a wild rover for many's the year, I've spent all me money on good weed and beer 
"
25,6,Randy,"Towelie... where is all the St. Patrick's Day Special?
"
25,6,Towelie,"Randy... I... I thought... you were in jail.
"
25,6,Randy,"The weed's all gone, does that mean you were able to sell it?
"
25,6,Towelie,"Yeah I sort of... sold it... at half price... to Tolkien's dad across the street.
"
25,6,Randy,"What?!
"
25,6,Towelie,"You were gone! Tolkien's dad said he'd buy all the weed and I figured that's what we should do!
"
25,6,Randy,"So you mean that right now everyone down at the Irish bar is enjoying my special and they don't even know it?!
"
25,6,Towelie,"Randy, I'm sorr-- 
"
25,6,Randy,"Come on, let's go! 
"
25,6,Steve,"Thank you! Thank you! Thanks for choosing Credigree Weed!
"
25,6,Randy,"Stop right there, you piece a shit!  Is everyone enjoying the special?!
"
25,6,Steve,"Randy... I-I thought you were in jail. 
"
25,6,Randy,"Oh, yes, so did a lot of people. But you see there's just one thing wrong.  This isn't Credigree Weed's special.  It's moine. 
"
25,6,Linda Black,"Babe! That's how you got so much weed?! 
"
25,6,Steve,"I used both.
"
25,6,Randy,"You see?! This is what happens when you appropriate a culture! It's sort of your special and it's sort of not your special... And nobody knows whose special it is.
"
25,6,Steve,"I guess I just let the holiday go to my head. But I learned that--
"
25,6,Randy,"No! No no no no no! You don't get to say what you learned 'cause it's not your special! This holiday is about Tegridy.
"
25,6,Woman,"Oh my God! It's him! It's the sexual predator! 
"
25,6,Stevens," What, what, he's here?!
"
25,6,Butters,"Uh oh! 
"
25,6,Stevens," Stop right there!
"
25,6,Officer,"There he is, get him!
"
25,6,Butters,"Wahggh! 
"
25,6,Yates," Freeze!
"
25,6,Butters,"Ahghggh! 
"
25,6,Yates,"Don't move, Weinstein, you've got nowhere else to go! 
"
25,6,Saint Patrick," Leave the child alone... 
"
25,6,Everyone,"Ohh!
"
25,6,Randy,"Whoa-a-a!
"
25,6,Butters,"It's him! It's St. Patrick!
"
25,6,Saint Patrick,"What... exactly is going on here. You've persecuted this little boy for grabbing people? Why, it's ridiculous! You've all besmirched a perfectly good white holiday. Where we all like to get drunk and assault each other! It's St. Patrick's Day!  Remember the reason for the season! 
"
25,6,Woman,"Oh, my God!
"
25,6,Woman,"Ooh! Hey!
"
25,6,Saint Patrick,"Who wants a pinch?  Oh, yes, very nice!
"
25,6,Man,"Hey, you can't do that, man!
"
25,6,Saint Patrick," What do you mean I can't? Do you know what day it is?!  Ah, see, here we go. ""Kiss me I'm Irish!"" That's more like it! 
"
25,6,Woman,"Oh, my God! 
"
25,6,Saint Patrick,"No, you bought the shirt, bitch!  Come on, let's have a go! It's me day! Take your dick out.  Who wants him to take his dick out?
"
25,6,Man,"I will not!
"
25,6,Saint Patrick,"What is this? Are you people all some kind of Scottish poofters?
"
25,6,Man,"Hey, that is a homophobic slur!
"
25,6,Saint Patrick,"You're calling me homophobic? Because I will gladly fuck any man here. We celebrate St. Patrick's Day for four simple reasons. I. Love. To. Fuck.
"
25,6,Man,"Wow, St. Patrick, wow. You're a real jerk.
"
25,6,Woman,"Yeah, what a creep. Come on girls, let's go. 
"
25,6,Man,"To hell with him and to hell with this Tegridy Weed St. Patrick's Day Special. 
"
25,6,Randy," Aw... Aww!
"
25,6,Saint Patrick,"Where is everybody going? This party fucking sucks! Doesn't anybody want a pinch?
"
25,6,Tom," The party is over... A new day has come...  And now... St. Patrick's Day, the only holiday left where white people could celebrate a culture... has been cancelled. And as for the mysterious, sexually charged being who groped and assaulted so many. He... is doing five years community service.
"
25,6,Butters,"Once again... I shoulda never listened to what they told me in church.
