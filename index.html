    <h1> Hello! </h1>
    <h1> I am Zach Carlson...</h1>
    <p> I am a Computer Science Student   at the University of Cincinnati.<br>  I am entering my 2nd year and 2nd     Semester.<br> I plan to graduate in May of 2024. <br><br> I am passionate about web development. I taught myself how to code in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 4, Javascript, PHP, and MySQL. I am still very far from being perfect and I am still learning. I am a very determined individual and a fast learner. I am always looking for opportunities to fine tune my web development skills and I am very eager to continue learning and growing professionally. My goal professionally is to go into web development. Currently I am very interested in front-end development because I have the most experience with it. I would also love to learn how to do some back-end development and possibly become a full-stack developer. This website is coding soley in HTML and CSS using Github.    </p>

    <h1 style="text-decoration: underline">Personal Reflection</h1>
    <p>My freshamn year of college I was a Computer Engineering major. After my first co-op with American Cutting Edge, I decided to switch majors to computer science because I feel in love with programming. Switching to computer science was a great decision I made because my love for programming has only grown. My second co-op with American Cutting Edge was a million times better than my first rotation. My first rotation was 100% remote and I felt that I wasn't making a huge impact. My second one I had the opportunity to work 100% on-site and my superiors giving me the project of coding the entire website by myself gave me a newfound passion for web development. A passion so great that I am heavily considering going into web devlopment as my career. Co-ops were the #1 reason I chose to attend the University of Cincinnati. Co-ops helped me grow as a computer scientist more than school has. School has taught me a lot, but Co-ops helped me grow a lot more. At first my co-op was a litle frustrating because I didn't know fully what to do and I wanted to make a larger impact. Once I got the website project I was extremely happy and fulfilled because that was the most perfect project for me to grow professionally. I have gained so much confidence professionally and as a computer scientist because of my co-op experiences. If I was to start all over again I would start in the computer science major. I would also have liked to get into web development a lot sooner. I am getting better and better at web development but I have so much more to learn and so much room to grow. My goals going forward are to continue to learn and grow in the web development field. In my remaining co-ops I would like to explore opportunities where I can code a lot more. I would love to grow more as a programmer and gain more skills that will better help me market myself for future job opportunities.
