                <p>My name is <strong>Zach Carlson</strong> <br />I am a 3rd year Computer Science student at The University of Cincinnati and I plan to graduate in 2024.</p>
            </div><br />
            <div class="intro-2">
                <p>I am passionate about web development. I taught myself how to code in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 4, Javascript, AngularJS, and MySQL. 
                I am still very far from being perfect and I am still learning. I am a very determined individual and a fast learner. 
                I am always looking for opportunities to fine tune my web development skills and I am very eager to continue learning and growing professionally. 
                My goal professionally is to go into web development. Currently I am very interested in front-end development because I have the most experience with it. 
                I would also love to learn how to do some back-end development and possibly become a full-stack developer.</p>

            This website is very far from perfect. There are a lot of different things I wish I could add to this website and they will come as I continue to learn and grow my    
            web development skills. Web design is also something I look to learn in the future because one of biggest parts of a website is the look and appeal to the site. 
            I haven't quite reached the look I want for this website yet but there is always room to grow and plenty of time to make changes through feedback and experience.</p>
